B000UWH40W,1298937600,"This is a beautiful GSM/3G phone with a bright, colorful screen and many features found in more expensive devices.  The Nokia 6555 will find the tower signal even if you live on Mars, and it will do it with great call clarity.  I have never had a more ergonomically pleasing keypad than the one on this phone---all buttons are smooth, require just the right amount of pressure, and they deliver the appropriate tactile feedback. BUT, battery life and function ruin an otherwise perfect machine. As other reviewers have aptly written, this phone ravishes battery power very quickly, even when you are cruising through the menus and not even talking. Adding insult to injury, the battery indicator on the screen drops slowly with the passing minutes then falls to ""low battery"" unexpectedly, oftentimes giving you a warning of a bare 3 minutes before all goes dead. I love this phone, BUT I ALWAYS CARRY MY OLD 5-YEAR-OLD NOKIA 1208 as a trusty backup. The 1208 has no internet, no camera, no bluetooth, and no music, but the battery lasts seemingly forever, and it will pick up a GSM signal maybe halfway to Mars. The Nokia 6555 is perfect except for its battery performance, but when I carry BOTH phones I get everything I need.

B000UWH40W,1193788800,"I've been a hard-core Nokia-only user for years (my last 4 or 5 phones.) My old candy-bar style Nokia with a tiny screen was getting old, so when I heard about this hot new flip phone from Nokia that was the same size, I wanted it.  Well, I got it and it isn't that great.  The 320x240 QVGA screen is nice and clear, but the software and services for it are not up to par with the latest from Sony, etc. that my friends at work show me.The USB connector is ""micro-USB"" so I had to order a new cable since all my cables are ""mini-USB"" which is only about 1mm larger.  Also, it has the narrow charging port, so all my old Nokia chargers are worthless.  The headphone jack is also micro-sized.  Who has micro-headphones?I'm pretty technically inclined, but I can't figure out how to wirelessly transfer my pictures off this camera.  So the 2 ways to get pics off are to buy the micro-USB cable, or yank out the micro-SD-RAM chip.

Let me preface my review by saying I upgraded from a classic design $50 Tmobile Nokia that I bought two years ago and which had no fancy features but served me well. So I decided to go for a Nokia phone again and decided to buy the Nokia 6555 :)My verdict is I think its awesome and I'm very happy with it. It takes great pictures, has a nice interface and is sleek and easy to manipulate (keys are great).Like previous reviewers, I was surprised that the battery doesn't necessarily last a day even with just phone usage since my previous basic phone had a battery life that lasted up to a week. However, after chatting to my friends (who thanked me for coming into the 21st century with my new phone), I discovered that most 3G phones have a short battery life.So in all, I am really happy with my upgraded phone and recommend it to any Nokia fans :)",4,"11 6, 2007",Awesome phone despite battery life,Cell Phones,"Nokia 6555 Unlocked GSM Flip Phone with 1.3MP Camera, Video MP3/Video Player, Bluetooth and microSD Slot - Black",94.38,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 85983},Nokia,Cell_Phones,0.75306,0,0.75306

This phone is a beautiful phone (I had the black and red version) and will slip into even a small pocket.  After purchasing the phone, I looked up the reviews.

(Turning it on at 7:00 a.m.; off at 6:00 p.m.; with about 50 minutes of talk time/day)  I decided to take the phone back since 2 years is a long time to have a phone that begins with disappointing features.  The AT&T service rep. took back the phone with no questions asked. Before I told the rep I was continuing with the service, she even asked if I wanted to cancel the 2-year contract.

B000UWH40W,1208131200,"First, the bad. I purchased the Nokia 6555b from AT&T; Jan 8, 2008. Three weeks later the exterior mini-display was cracked and inoperable. I had worn it on my belt while driving and my seat belt buckle put enough pressure on the mini-display to crack it. VERY disappointing. All Nokia had to do was put a thicker, more rigid plastic cover over the display and it would be fine. Instead, I have a busted phone. Except for the broken mini-display and the inability to see the clock or caller ID, the phone still works, but that mini-display is a Bad Design.A lot of people complain about the battery. At first I experienced very short battery times as well. I even bought a second battery for $15 with some other accessories. I have never needed it. I believe the battery gets better with time. At first it was displaying low battery charge. Now it goes for a couple of days no problem. I charge it each night, though, just to be safe.I bought the 6555 because it works with the Acura Hands Free Link system via Bluetooth. (Not all Bluetooth phones do.) It also works with the Ford Sync system. Both work very well. It is indeed nice to place or receive calls without having to find the phone. No clumsy earphones. No looking away to dial or press buttons. No wires at all. My wife leaves hers in her purse, I leave my in my pocket (not wearing it on my belt anymore--I might break it again.) With Sync, the Bluetooth even allows the phone to become a media player. Very cool.Using the free downloadable Nokia software, you can edit the phonebook from your laptop via the special--and hard to find--micro USB cable that costs $15. But if your laptop has Bluetooth like mine--because I bought a Microsoft Bluetooth wireless laser mouse 8000 and its Bluetooth receiver also receives other Bluetooth devices like my phone--you can connect without having to buy the micro USB cable. The cable is handy to carry though, so you can connect the phone to other computers if necessary to download pictures and video if needed. Using this software, you can also make your own ring tones. My custom ringtone is Hillary Clinton cackling/laughing.The main display has a nice large font that is visible in broad daylight. Color combinations (themes) are adjustable and some are better than others, but it's nice to have options.The phone has a speaker phone built in if desired.It's easy to switch from ring to vibrate--just hold the # key for a few seconds.If you have MS Outlook as your emailer, you can sync your calendar.The 6555 comes with a host of useful tools including: a Stopwatch with split times; a Countdown Timer to remember to take the roast out on time; a full-function Calculator; an Alarm Clock; Notes; To-Do list; and a Calendar.It has some dumb games that are mostly demo only.It has a very mediocre still camera and an even more mediocre video camera.It can text, but I don't do that.It can be configured for Push-To-Talk, at extra cost, if you must have walkie talkie capability.I was worried about the tiny charging plug, but so far it's been durable, even though it did obsolete all my previous Nokia accessories.It does need a micro-mini plug for the headphones if you want to use it as a personal music player. Mine included a short Micro-to-Standard mini adapter so you can use your regular headphones.The Settings menu allows you to reconfigure what many of the buttons will do: if you need to get to some buried menu item like the calculator often, make the Right Selector button do it. One touch and you're in business. This is a very handy feature.Overall, I am quite pleased with the phone. The audio quality is fine, it rarely drops calls and is small, thin and lightweight. The only real problem is how fragile the outer display is. Nokia should have shipped it with a protector or engineered it better from the get-go.",3,"04 14, 2008",Good but fragile,Cell Phones,"Nokia 6555 Unlocked GSM Flip Phone with 1.3MP Camera, Video MP3/Video Player, Bluetooth and microSD Slot - Black",94.38,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 85983},Nokia,Cell_Phones,0.0346976,0.011565867,0.023131733
B000UWH40W,1197504000,"I replaced my Motorola L6 with this Nokia 6555. I liked the L6 except the keys were very small and close together, so I would sometimes hit the wrong key. Also, I had to lock the keys whenever I carried it so a key would not get pressed accidentally. What I needed was a flip phone with slightly larger keys and this Nokia was just the ticket.This cell phone has so many features that I will only list a few. First off, my friend just got a Samsung Blackjack II and this Nokia does almost all the same things that his does. They both have MP3, 3G, Bluetooth, internet access, camera, Micro SD memory ready, organizer, and more with services through ATT. As far as we can tell thus far is the only thing the Smartphones have the Nokia 6555 does not have is Microsoft Mobile Suite. The Blackjack keys are so tiny that I do not know how anyone can use them. Plus, the Blackjack cost much more. The better choice is by far the Nokia 6555.The only problem I am having is navigating the menus to find the settings I am looking for. I have to keep referring to the manual. I suppose after a while I will learn where everything is and memorize most of it.The battery life seems to be about average for a fully loaded cell phone. Maybe some day they will make batteries that last much longer for those power users that complain about short battery talk time. For now we just have to charge the battery more often. Not a big deal for me. If I plan to use the phone a lot, then I simply charge my phone and headset at night to have a full charge on both and I am ready to go the next day. If I do not use it very much, then I only have to charge them about every 3 or 4 days.Pros:Slim and stylish.Good sound quality.Many features.Cons:Menus difficult to navigate.UPDATE:Another con is the backlight only stays on for 10 seconds and there is no way to adjust it to stay on longer.",5,"12 13, 2007",This phone does just about everything,Cell Phones,"Nokia 6555 Unlocked GSM Flip Phone with 1.3MP Camera, Video MP3/Video Player, Bluetooth and microSD Slot - Black",94.38,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 85983},Nokia,Cell_Phones,-0.27939,-0.139695,-0.139695

I did my homework before going to the store and I had narrowed my decision to 2 phones (an LG and a different model Nokia).  However, when I got to the store, I let the salesman talk me into this phone, which he said was a better quality, though at a higher price.  I took it home and immediately had problems. The vibration function did not work, no matter how much I adjusted settings, and the manual was no help.  I went online and saw that almost every review for this phone was negative.  Just this afternoon, the vibration miraculously started working, though intermittently, which confirmed to me that I had a defective phone.  I also was having problems with it powering down by itself, or suddenly lighting up--which was very annoying because I use my phone as an alarm clock so all of a sudden I would be awaken by a bright light in my room.  Perhaps mine was a lemon, however based on the other reviews I read, lemons with this model seem to happen fairly often.I also found that the way the operating system on the phone was set up was not very intuitive.  Maybe I just didn't spend enough time getting used to it (though I did spend about 4 hours on it last night trying to figure it out).  I consider myself fairly tech savvy, but I just don't understand why they make simple tasks like setting an alarm for am or pm require an additional 3 button pushes.  I also didn't need any of the ""sophisticated"" features, I only needed a phone that worked well as a phone, and that could text with relative simplicity.  The sound quality and signal strength were fairly good, but that was dwarfed by the other problems I was having. Based on my experience thus far, and the reviews I saw online, I took it back today and got the phone I originally was going to get.

B000WLZTTO,1187827200,"Actually, I bought this phone by mistake, since I thought it wouldn't be shipped all the way to Colombia, but it did (in less than seven days). To this point I had only bought books through Amazon and in trying to buy other products had failed due to shipping restrictions, although Amazon and its reseller E-tronics came through this time. Great job guys.Ok, down the brass tax: the Nokia N73 ME is a complete multimedia experience, camera, music player, and yes a phone, complete with all the extras, which led me to sell my old iPod just last week. And since I didn't own a camera, it was fantastic. The camera works great (for a phone), although, you have to become a wiz at adjusting all the settings it comes packed with for your picture to come out great in environments with little light. I'm totally psyched with it, shooting everything that moves. The Symbian OS is well designed and pretty robust, supporting any kind of application you might find.The only downside is that at the beginning it was a little slow while browsing in between applications. But you can fix this problem by downloading the Nokia Software Updater which allows you to update your phone's firmware. I updated my N73 with the latest version (v.4.0727.2.2.1) and the problem was solved, along with dozens of other bugs. And in sync with the Nokia PC Suite it's like having your office in your pocket. Really it is.OK buddy, that's it for now. Hats off to Nokia for making an awesome phone. Your bank account might get pissed off, but your life will most definitely improve: your life in there. Oh, and the best of all is that my childish and unfounded need for the coveted iPhone is now gone.

B001F7VN6M,1282521600,"I waited until this phone was offered by Amazon directly because a year ago I purchased a BB Pearl from another vendor through Amazon and it did not last a year, failing from day one.  This time, I thought Amazon would be a more trustworthy source it was quite disappointing.  I got a phone in it's own box but firs thing that stroke me, a 1 year warranty card from Consumer Certified Repairs... this phone is supposed to be new!!!  I got a refurbished phone!!  Next disappointment, a cheap battery, not the original Blackberry battery.  It holds a charge for about 8 hours.  I had to but another one, which was another nightmare because Amazon sells many as ""the same that comes with Blackberry phones"" and the picture is of an original battery at $15.  Now I don't trust Amazon so I did not purchase any of these but had to shell out another $50 for a Seidio.  Another thing, I believe this phone should've included a protective ""leather"" case which comes with every BB and I did not get it.  Now my last and greatest grievance and it goes in another paragraph...I was not able to get this phone on a Blackberry plan!!  At the phone company they told me that the series this phone belongs to is not in the Blackberry database so it cannot be set up in the BB plan!  I did not get any specifics, not sure what that means and not even sure if it is banned for any reason or what.  Anyways, this is the last time I buy a cell phone from Amazon.

So anyway, the phone arrived in excellent condition (although it seems like this was a factory refurbished phone, but it still looked like new). I saw a little scratch on the screen when I unwrapped it, but it turns out the scratch was only on the plastic cover and didn't affect the phone.

B001F7VN6M,1278892800,"...and what do I mean by that title line, exactly?The Blackberry Bold 9000 is, in essence, a small computer (as are all smartphones.) The leading trendy iCompetitor to the Blackberry may have some limitations, but running the most basic of audio editing/composition apps isn't one of them: the Blackberry on the other hand has its audio hardware set up to only be able to play one [generated] sound at a time - i.e. it lacks true polyphony. This shouldn't be a showstopper - buffered synthesis being one possible solution - and yet there's not even the most basic MIDI composition available for the Bold.To which the BB die-hards reply, ""Ah, but the Blackberry's not a toy! It's a businessman's machine! Blackberry users are serious businesslike people.""...and yet there are apps available for astrology, palm reading, bible quotes, random noise players, etc. etc. - obviously all very relevant and important to business people. [eyes rolling]In the end, it's been a fine smartphone for me in just about every other regard more or less. A couple hassles, most easy to figure out with a little Google sleuthing.

They've always done me right. This time, they did not. They basically told me to take it to an Apple Store. I paid $250 for this phone. I paid $250, for a working, functional phone, that was almost ""Like New"". Amazon has lost a lot of credibility among the online community, with lackluster service and promotions. They've definitely lost another customer with me. All I want is the phone replaced with a working phone, that my girlfriend can use. Is that too much to ask? A simple replacement?To anyone reading this, if you are looking to buy a phone, do not do it from these people. Save your money, and just buy it off Craigslist.

Big mistake.In the first six months of owning it, aside from running a bit fast, it looked great, felt solid, and had no problems.  Then the date stopped flipping over- it would bind up between the numbers, and require manual adjustment every day.So, like the good little consumer that I am, I brought it into my authorized Tag Heuer dealer, warranty card in hand, and they sent it off to Switzerland.  I get a phonecall about two weeks later saying that the top pusher for the date wheel was broken, and that Tag would not cover it under warranty, as I must have dropped or abused the watch.  Meanwhile, I have babied this watch, and it looks as good as the day I bought it.  Tag Heuer wanted $240 to replace what is likely a single, tiny part that should be covered under warranty anyway.  I told them to go scratch, and am taking it to a friend's jeweler, since it's obviously not worth maintaining the Tag Heuer warranty anyway.I should have known better than to buy an LVMH product, as the company is so obviously evil.  I was contemplating purchasing a Grand Carrera, but in light of this experience, I'll probably get a Baume & Mercier instead.  How Tag Heuer/LVMH has the gall to sell a ""luxury"" product that can't stand up to six months of intended use by a member of the intended demographic (young professional just starting to spend real money on timepieces) and then refuse to stand behind it is just beyond me.

So I spent at least a couple of months looking on the Internet and came up this this watch. Then I spent 3 weeks looking at prices on stores, the internet, etc. I found out that a TAG watch that is bought through Amazon or other web site, won't have TAG warranty but sellers warranty (and that's why a watch like this will be sold for $2.5K on stores-AD). So I looked up everywhere about Jomashop and found reviews where good, the seller is totally legitimate and it had the best deals (by the way, you can buy the watch on Jomashop site and use Amazon payment....that's how I found a better deal there than in Amazon).The watch:I cannot describe how beautiful and detailed the watch is. You could go to youtube and find reviews from others and have an idea of how the watch looks. But was the movie Inception where I saw the watch which is wear by Di Caprio throughout the movie. The second hand movement is just nice to see, the crystal is very clear and the size of the watch is just the right one (39mm without the crown).I regret that some other reviewers have had a bad experience about the watch.

First off, I would like to address all the other reviewers who complained about this watch's accuracy.  I've had mine for just a little over a year now and it has consistently run about 8 to 10 seconds fast per day.  This is PERFECTLY NORMAL for a mechanical watch.  Some mechanical watches will be far more accurate while others will be somewhat less.  If this is NOT accurate enough for you, you shouldn't bother buying a mechanical watch.  Please just purchase a quartz watch and let the rest of us enjoy the art of a finely crafted mechanical watch.Now onto the watch.  It's 39mm across and only about 12 or 13mm thick so this is definitely not a large watch by today's standards, but this is the reason why I like it.  Some watches, especially dress watches, shouldn't be too large.  My wrists are definitely on the small side (6.25"") but this watch looks perfect on me.  It has a jet black dial which actually has two different textures.  The smaller inner circle (inside of the hour markers) is perfectly smooth while the outer circle has very fine concentric circles that go all the way out to the outer edges of the hour markers.  I found this to be a very nice touch and prevents the dial from appearing too bland.The back of the watch is beautifully polished to match the front and also features a see through window.  This glass is actually sapphire, just like the front, which is nice because it is much more resistant to scratches than a cheaper mineral crystal.  Through the caseback, you can catch a glimpse of the heart of this watch which is the calibre 5 movement.  Tag Heuer labels this movement as the calibre 5, but you should be aware that this is really just a modified and dressed up ETA 2824-2 movement.  This is NOT a knock on the watch, though, as the 2824 is an extremely reliable workhouse that is certainly capable of COSC certification.  Google the ""ETA 2824-2"" and you can see for yourself the history of this wonderful movement.The bracelet is by far the most comfortable stainless steel bracelet that I have ever worn.  The links are relatively small which allows for a great degree of flexibility.  This enables the bracelet to contour to your wrist much more efficiently.  While the bracelet is not particularly heavy, the links definitely have a solid feel to them.  Even the end links are solid, which I would expect in this price range.  The push button release is also a favorite of mine.  It is very secure and looks much better on a dress watch than the more common foldover with safety clasp.Overall, I am extremely pleased with this watch.  It exudes quality and is extremely handsome.  It has a timeless look that I know will never look too dated.  The few drawbacks I can think of are the lack of an antireflective coating on the sapphire crystal and the price.  There are numerous 2824-2's that can be had for far less money.  Still, I have no regrets purchasing this watch and would highly recommend it to anyone who's looking for a quality mechanical watch.",5,"06 15, 2010",Beautiful and classy,Luxury Watches,Tag Heuer Carrera Automatic Mens Watch WV211B.BA0787,NA,{'Watches': 34288},TAG Heuer,Apparel,0.471708,0.2948175,0.1768905

This makes it difficult to stash just anyplace in the car (fit's pretty good in a cup holder) and definately will not fit in your pocket. It is perfectly round and smooth which have two drawbacks; if your fingers are slick it can be hard to open the case as there are no tabs or indentations to get a hold of and if the surface you set it down on is not flat, it will take off on you.

It has this nice owners manual that comes in a leather pouch.  It looks like something that would come with a luxury car.  The book is about 90 pages, but there are only 5 in English.  The rest of the book are the instruction printed in about 20 other languages.The watch lists for $2000 dollars, but can be purchased much less (such as here on Amazon).  But, if you go to a store like Macy's, it will be $2000.Since I didn't get the watch at jewelry store, I had to pay someone ($37) to fit the band to my wrist.  You probably have to do the same if you get if from Amazon.  I am pretty mechanically inclined, but I couldn't figure out how to remove the links.  I took it to Macy's watch repair, and it took them a while to figure out how to do it.When the battery dies (in 1 to 5 years, depending on who you believe), it will cost you about $200 to get TAG to replace.  But, you can probably go somewhere else for much cheaper.I have the watch and I will probably keep wearing it.  I don't like it, but I am just as vain as the next guy, and I want to show off my $2000 watch.  But, looking back, I probably should have tried to sell it on eBay and used the money for something worth while (like 100 GPS watches).",2,"11 5, 2009",For those who have money to burn.,Accessories,TAG Heuer Men's WJ1111.BA0570 Link Series Watch,NA,{'Watches': 20405},TAG Heuer,Apparel,-0.112909,0,-0.112909

B000A0S4AS,1166400000,"After combing different websites and Authorized dealers, as well as having prior Tag's, I have a decent sense of what Tag Heuer has to offer, as well as different price points.  I was looking to upgrade to something in the one thousand to 1.5 thousand price range, and this watch was on the short list.  I decided on this one because of Amazon's 5 yr warranty, automatic movement (which frequently runs $2K+), and slick, refined looks.Definitely wanted something that wasn't too bulky, but still was relatively masculine.  Just a few things that I can share with all:PRO's:-nice bracelet, and very adjustable (with a micro adjustment in the clasp)-automatic movement at a decent price-waterproof to 200m-bracelet doesn't catch any hairs-simple, elegant design to dress up or downCON's:-needs a break-in period (I almost returned mine, but you need to wear it for 2 weeks straight to get all the automatic mechanisms lubricated)- +/- a few seconds a day-Not a chronometer (which is ""certified"") - but this adds hundreds of dollars more at ? benefit-the edge of the face/bezel is a polished metal, and I can envision it getting scratched (so, if you are rough on your watches, you might want to pick a style with a rotating bezel to ""protect"" the face)-the LINK bracelet is tough to adjust by yourself, so you need to go to a jeweler/watch store to adjust it-as with all automatics you need to wear it at least once every 2-3 days (or wind it up every 2 days) to keep from having to reset the timeAnother tip - during the break in period, make sure you wind up the watch (turn clockwise) when you first get it, and perhaps another time or two during the first week - this gave it an extra oomph to get things going.",5,"12 18, 2006",Solid Tag Heuer with a sweet bracelet,Jewelry: International Shipping Available,TAG Heuer Men's WJF2111.BA0570 Link Automatic Stainless Steel Watch,NA,{'Watches': 132519},TAG Heuer,Apparel,0.752919,0,0.752919

They've always done me right. This time, they did not. They basically told me to take it to an Apple Store. I paid $250 for this phone. I paid $250, for a working, functional phone, that was almost ""Like New"". Amazon has lost a lot of credibility among the online community, with lackluster service and promotions. They've definitely lost another customer with me. All I want is the phone replaced with a working phone, that my girlfriend can use. Is that too much to ask? A simple replacement?To anyone reading this, if you are looking to buy a phone, do not do it from these people. Save your money, and just buy it off Craigslist.

B004ZLV5PE,1381449600,"I purchased 2 Apple iPhone 4 phones from iDeal Expert last month: both looked brand new...but clearly, looks can be deceiving.From the start, one phone had a problem where the recipient heard a strong echo/distortion when speaking which interfered with the conversation. When I sent an email through Amazon clearly articulating the problem to the company, I received a brief response from their team: ""Have you tried calling the manufacture for an exchange?"".Considering my options, I decided to take my phone to an expert to see whether he could solve the problem.  A couple of seconds after opening the case, he told me that the phone was not a new one, but refurbished.  At a glance, he could see clear evidence of water damage, and it was missing all kinds of screws, fasteners..etc.I was horrified to learn this, and deeply troubled that iDeal Expert considers this acceptable practice - particularly given their supposed ""Complete Customer Satisfaction Guarantee: We stand behind the quality of our products with an iron-clad 100% guarantee. We are in the business of building long-term relationships with our customers, and we are confident that you will be satisfied with each and every purchase made from us.  We offer an exclusive EZ NO-HASSLE RETURN POLICY.  If for any reason you are not satisfied, simply send your product back to us for an immediate replacement or refund.""In my opinion, iDeal Expert has displayed a flagrant disregard of integrity and have manifest very poor business ethics and practice. I fail to see how such behaviour can lead to ""long-term relationships"", nor to fully-satisfied customers.If my experience is anything to go by, my strong recommendation to all potential purchasers is ""BUYERS BEWARE!"".UPDATE: shortly after my posting, I received an email from the iDeal Expert team as follows: ""This was bought in August, we are now in OCTOBER and cannot accept a return this is past 60 days and we will not accept a return."" I responded to correct their error - reminding them that I had in fact notified their team of the problem well within the time frame, and had even received their acknowledgement of that email.I remain deeply concerned that iDeal Xpert has not only sold defective goods, but then chose to use their 60-time period as an excuse for not dealing with the problem. I still fail to see how such poor business practices are deemed acceptable by the company.UPDATE #2: today, the screen of my iPhone 4 went blank...without any warning, nor any good reason.

It is an extremely well made phone and would rate 5 stars except for the fact that the iPhone 5 is dramatically better in every respect but one.The actual phone reception (on ATT anyway) is much better on the 5 - it's LTE in many parts of the country and that's better than ATTs usual crap network.The 5 is significantly thinner and lighter than the 4 (not that the 4 is exactly heavy.)  It has a greater storage capacity (64GB) which means you can carry more stuff with you.  The screen is slightly larger without making it more difficult to carry - an extra row of applications.  A small but not insignificant advantage - especially for web browsing.But what really makes it better is the chip speed and processing power.  Browsing on line on the iPhone 4 is slow and frustrating.  But on the iPhone 5 it's very quick and responsive - a dramatic improvement that makes the phone and many apps much more useful.The new ear buds are okay but I'm not sure I like them as much as the old ones.  So sometimes I use the old ones.The new cable is much smaller and more convenient except that I have all the old ones (one is included).  Oh well, the price of improvement (they needed to change the connector to make it really thin.)The one knock against it is that the headphone jack is on the bottom instead of the top.  I hate that even though I've kind of gotten used to it at this point.  I think that was a mistake.So net net - this is is actually a great phone and you can get it for almost nothing.  But if you've got the $199 (or $127 at Wal-Mart) for the iPhone 5, I'd spring for it.  Given how much you'll use it, it will cost you about a 25 a day for the best.The only problem is that Amazon as of this writing seems not to be selling it.",3,"12 22, 2012",iPhone 5 is better,Cell Phones,Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - AT&amp;T,269.95,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1960},Apple,Cell_Phones,-0.178153,0,-0.178153

B004ZLV5PE,1386547200,"The iPhone 4 was my maiden voyage into the world of touchscreen phones. Prior to that, I had a Palm Centro, and before that I had been a fan of Motorola's Razr phones (which are still some of my favorite). I was a fan of Palm's organizational apps, and the keyboard was great, but holy moly was it behind three or five years in terms of Internet compatibility. Still, the organization and tactile feel prevented me from switching over to an iPhone or Droid, not to mention the high cost of obtaining a data plan, though I had been following Apple's technological progress since the early 2000s.Nevertheless, once the iPhone 4 was revealed, and some final convincing from a relative, I made the switch, and I, like millions of consumer, can gladly say I never will look back.(Though I quickly will mention that I still miss the tactile feel of physical keyboards.)Because I have made it a habit to be technologically and gadget savvy, I already knew how to navigate through an iPhone, and had a long list of apps I wanted to download. Since I didn't own any of the phones before, I can't compare them hardware-wise, but software-wise we all can agree that Apple takes a few steps forward, but makes a couple bumps along the way.The first big feature to grace the iOS upgrade for me was the Notifications. I realize that many had been clamoring for this, and it was a welcome addition when it was released, but over time it has become quite cumbersome to manage with the different security settings Apple has included.I still use the iPhone 4 to this day, though mostly as a workout companion. It has a noticeable weight compared to my iPhone 5, yet I actually prefer it as it feels sturdier in my palm. And since I'm used to the iPhone 5 now, the iPhone 4 seems to perform a lot slower than before, especially with iOS 7, and the battery drains faster now, but it still manages to load all the apps designed for iOS 7. Not bad for a three-year-old phone.While I certainly like the iPhone 5 and its ability to store an extra line of apps, I prefer the squatter iPhone 4 for its size. It's easier in the hand, and it feels more portable as it takes up less room in my pocket.iPhones are nice to have, but I'm seriously considering a Droid next. Apple's products just aren't up to some of the competitors' capabilities in terms of gaming and customization. I love video games, and the iPhone has some amazing software, but their limitations only serve as a downgrade.Still, for the general public, I'd say Apple is the way to go.",5,"12 9, 2013",First iPhone is a great iPhone.,Cell Phones,Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - AT&amp;T,269.95,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1960},Apple,Cell_Phones,0.0193351,0,0.0193351

B004ZLV5PE,1389657600,"I have never owned a smart phone before, but most of my friends own iPhones. Last May, after becoming a bit more financial stable, I made my first smart phone purchase and bought an iPhone 4.I am relatively new to cell phones in general (I&#8217;ve only owned a cell phone for five years), so purchasing a smart phone was a big deal for me. Although I know the benefits that come from owning a smart phone, I wasn&#8217;t sure at the time if I was making the right purchase. I like the physical feel of a QWERTY keyboard. I don&#8217;t download a ton of data. Compared to most of my peers, I don&#8217;t even text that much. Despite this, I have been pleased with my iPhone 4.The basic apps that come with the phone are easy to use. Software updates can be set to download automatically or manually.Security is a major concern and you can change the settings to make your phone secure or as open as you would like.I hardly ever downloaded anything with my old phone (it wasn&#8217;t a smart phone anyway), but I have noticed a huge advantage in the speed of whenever I do download something on my iPhone 4.I love the camera functions of the phone. I had a camera on my old phone, but the difference in pixels is extraordinary. Not only that, but I can take extended videos, too.Physically, the phone is of a design that is pleasing to the eye and the phone is extremely lightweight. With that said, I highly recommend getting some sort of real protection for the phone (such as an Otterbox or Lifeproof) because although this is a great phone, it is not at all durable and the glass can easily crack or completely break if it&#8217;s dropped on a hard surface.My only major complaint about the iPhone 4 (and all Apple products in general) is that it does not include an operating manual. Sure it comes with a little pamphlet about how to turn the phone on and off and what buttons to use, but that&#8217;s not a manual. That&#8217;s a mini-instruction guide and nothing more; it has no real knowledge of how to actually use your phone, for instance, it doesn&#8217;t tell you how to download apps, how to open the apps already included, what apps are included, etc. I have never understood the concept of selling an electronic device, but not including a manual about how to operate it. Apple is terrible with this (as is Adobe in the world of software-they never include manuals for anything either). You do a major disservice to your customers when you don&#8217;t include a manual. As much as I have liked the few Apple products I have owned, they will always be a step below of what they could be for not having a manual.In general, I am very pleased with the iPhone 4. It&#8217;s been a good cell phone for me so far and if you can deal with not having a manual, I recommend it for someone looking to purchase a smart phone for the first time.",4,"01 14, 2014",This iPhone Is Now My Phone,Cell Phones,Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - AT&amp;T,269.95,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1960},Apple,Cell_Phones,0.423936,0,0

B004ZLV5UE,1305417600,"Everybody maligned AT&T; for their service, but the Verizon service is no better because of the hardware.  In places I used to get 4 or 5 bars with my old LG phone, I get 1 or 2 bars with the iphone until I try to connect and it drops out.  The call quality is abysmal compared to the old LG phone when the signal is less than 3 bars.  I've tried the silicone ring around the edges as suggested for the early iphones with minimal results. It does everything but act like a good phone.  Another annoyance is the touch screen has no adjustment; unless you use a (special) stylus or have very skinny fingers,  touching the screen may take you somewhere you don't intend and for many menus there is no simple single step back to correct the mistake.  It certainly doesn't live up to all of the hype; it is basically an ipod that may work as a phone if you have a good signal.  Another dubious feature is virtual signal strength bars.  Before dialing it will show 5 bars only to drop to one as soon as it tries to connect.Update: The iphone died so that I cannot hear if I hold it up to my ear just after the warranty expired!  I tried everything I could find on line to reset it; now it only is functional with a Bluetooth, wired hands free device or the terrible sounding speaker phone option; a major inconvenience. I'm anything but impressed by the lack of quality and poor ergonomics.

B004ZLV5UE,1380931200,"I recently purchased an Iphone 4s.  Although I said no to downloading OS7, it downloaded when I finally gave in to the keyboard fix and really, really makes the Iphone very hard to read because it has a transparent look to help you with other applications.  When you go online, you now have WHITE LETTERS against a WHITE BACK GROUND or white letters against a light green back ground which you cannot fix on your phones screen!  You now have to darken the back ground (I use BLACK NOW!),  just to be able to see your ICONS and applications better!  The download also changes your address book and not all address/contacts will sync between my MacBookPro and my IPhone 4s?  Yes, I called tech support but they do not have an answer as to why apple did this new look.  I called tech support twice before I did the KeyBoard Fix and was advised TWICE by tech support (documented at apple support) as the fix required 3.1 GB!  When I asked apple why the file was so big, I was advised not to worry as the fix would leave everything on my phone the same as it was but the down load needed that space to down load the 4s keyboard fix.  What really happens is you end up with the look of the cheaper IPhone C.  Apple ruined the 4s with this recent upgrade to OS7 operating system which went from easy to see, easy to read, easy to sync, to almost impossible unless you keep adjusting the brightness for each article you want to read-what a pain!.  I AM DONE WITH APPLE PRODUCTS UNLESS THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR MISTAKE WITH A FIX, TO MAKE MY 4S LOOK AND WORK THE WAY I PURCHASED IT!  It is now almost impossible to go on line and read anything as the screen gives out a powerful white back light that makes you just give up on using your apple IPhone to do any type of research which means staring at the screen which really makes you physically ill (check reports of such on line).  This is the first negative report I have ever given to APPLE.  Their tech support is the best!  But, even tech support can not fix a basic, powerful, APPLE, misstep.  Why apple decided to make the OS7 change the screen on the Iphone 3, 3s, 4, 4s very hard to see with the human eye, is totally beyond my comprehension! Who wants a phone with great apps if you CAN'T READ THE DARN SCREEN!  There should be a warning that states this keyboard patch will COMPLETELY INSTALL A NEW OPERATING SYSTEM.  IF YOU DO NOT USE OS7, THEN OS7 SHOULD WARN YOU THAT YOU ARE INSTALLING A NEW OPERATING SYSTEM THAT WILL COMPLETELY CHANGE HOW YOUR PHONE LOOKS AND OPERATES.  APPLE JUST WANTS TO FORCE YOU INTO OS7.",1,"10 5, 2013","DO NOT BUY older IPHONES, OS7 WILL RUIN IT.",Cell Phones,Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - CDMA Verizon,178,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 505},Apple,Cell_Phones,-0.109059,0,0

So, when my last phone (a very old LG Cosmos Touch) fell in the drink, took in just seconds of water, there was no saving it no matter what I did to help revive it; I began my venture.  I searched high phones and researched the low phones;  phones of all makes and models.  My adult daughter has had her iPhone4 for over a yr. and has just raves about it.  I of course had to explore this &#8216;rave&#8217; area as well.

Palm friendly size.  Only two color choices.  But don&#8217;t most people use a cover or case these days?  Use as an iPod for music and HD videos, sounds are crisp and clear with great retina display.  Average picture ability, front, and back cameras with 5X zoom.  Long life battery for average talk and data uses.  Well ya'll can look up the specs but this is the precise phone I needed for my uses at the best price.

B004ZLV5UE,1367798400,"Over the weekend I got the Apple iPhone 4, and decided to go through Verizon. I was on straight talk and had an Ascend 2. I wanted to switch earlier, but just didn't have the funds. So being that the iPhone 4 was free, all I had to pay was 125 dollar desposit,and after that get a case since I have had previous bad luck dropping the phone. I like the over all design and lets be honest even though this thing is a 3G phone is still great. It's incredibly responsive. I have mine in a case but the touch pad is just right. I am tall and have long fingers. I need a big keyboard and the iPhone 4's keypad is plenty big for my fingers. Occasionally auto correct has me going back to correct a few things but its not nearly as bad as my previous phones with cricket/straight talk.By the way for anybody who has Straight talk let me just say that I'm in no way discouraging you from Straight talk. I was in a position to either buy a phone outright and pay the 49 to continue my service, or get a free phone and maybe pay a little more for luxury I hadn't previously had. I didn't have the 600 bucks for an expensive phone so I went with this phone. I'm going to be stuck with it for 2 years, but the way I see it is this. I love the phone. A lot of friends and even my brother do not like Apple, or the iPhone craze, or the perceived craze. But it works for what I need and that is the most important thing.I would definitely recommend the iPhone 4 to anybody who wants to give it a trial run. I fell in love with his little phone and I don't see why anybody else wouldn't. I'm on the 2GB plan and so far its all I need. Should I need more I'll adjust it. But as of right now I'm very happy with my new phone and also the switch to Verizon.So when you look at it from a perspective of what you need it works. Doesn't make you obnoxious for having an iPhone. Just maybe that you were a little curious. You decided to try and maybe you'll fall in love with his model. While itunes is great. Haven't used it yet. But I like it for everything else.Give it a try and maybe you'll surprise yourself.

B004ZLV5UE,1371340800,"Well lets get to it. Long story short, I got this phone as an upgrade from verizon. Was free (well verizon FRee means 30 dollar upgrade) so I figured why not. Here is the breakdown.Pros+Phone works flawless+No lost calls+Clear screen+Good lighting+Light+ThinCons-Entire thing is made of glass! I broke mine the first day! And I am very very very careful about things that are fragile. Life happened and I dropped it because it slipped off my lap, 1 foot drop at best. Front smashed in, no longer could use it.-Had to buy replace screen (icracked 65 dollars, dont use them they are terrible also) screen now works but has lines through it and black patch marks on it. Takes away from the picture, and it was insane to fix in the first place. For apple to fix, it will cost you 200 dollars.-Had to buy a case for the phone, a tough as nails case from Otter Box (they are good) cost 60 bucks.-Because of the case (which you WILL need) now the phone is bulky and no longer thin.-Insurance for the phone with verizon is insane at price, 15 dollars a month forever. And if you break it you still have to pay 150 out of pocket to replace!All in all, the phone itself works great. But what is holding the phone together is pure trash and a gimmick to get you to buy more stuff. Free phone really means Phone Upgrade $30 + Phone Case $60 + Phone screen replace $65= $155 dollar free phone. I will never buy from apple or this phone again.

It is still slower than I had anticipated (perhaps there really is a difference between the 4 and the 4s that I had before) but at least it functions. The first iPhone that I received had a completely dysfunctional battery. After returning it to the company (to the incorrect address that I was given), I received the same phone with a new battery weeks later. It was still unusable, though it ceased the sporadic battery loss after the first day of use. The phone refused to stay connected to Wi-fi for more than 45 seconds, which became almost comical. Almost. After complaining extensively to Brad's voicemail and via email (I don't think we ever spoke on the phone except the first time I called) I was sent a new-used-iPhone, seriously nicked, which functions well enough.

It does not get 4GLTE so it is slower and personally, I think the camera sucks.  So if you want a FREE phone, I would still say pay extra to get a later generation because eventually, this will be too slow to handle new apps.I noticed that Amazon will buy back the three different models almost reflects the difference for ordering a new phone from Verizon with a new 2 year contract e.g. if the 4 is free with new contract, the best offer from Verizon is $125 and so if the 5 is $200 from Verizon, then the best offer from Amazon is $335.  The iphones still have better resale value than other smartphones although all are in the $200 range for the newest phones.  This may be something to consider when choosing a phone.The battery takes about one hour to become fully charged.

B004ZLV5UE,1369180800,"Well this is my first ever customer review, but I gotta say that this is actually in better condition than I expected. I checked the new and used prices and found one called ""Hollywood Merchandise"" and something else, the cost was only $175 plus tax which came out to $179. It actually came very fast. Shipped in two days, considering I live in California though. But where I live is completely on the other side of California.Down to the condition though.The condition of this phone is pretty good. It came packaged into USPS, the mailman left a key in my mailbox which opens the big boxlike part of the mailbox, bubble wrapped packaging in an orange envelope for papers, the iPhone was in a box that says ""iPhone"" on the front of it with a picture of the iPhone 4, nothing more. Came with a charger cable and a USB wall adapter, a pair of microphone earbuds (pretty cheap, but still.), and the iPhone had a screen protector on it to protect any scratches while being shipped and it also lied down on its face with some black plastic thing to protect the back of the iPhone. The phone was also inactivated ! I was worried I was going to order an activated iPhone that was someone else's. But the only things that were wrong with the phone is that you can tell someone left an otterbox defender case on it for roughly over 6 months at least. It is a tad bit scratched but I actually just rubbed rubbing alcohol on it and it cleared up fairly well. I mean the scratches are still there but it's not something you notice the first time when holding the phone. The last thing is that the vibration on the phone makes a disturbing sound, as if the phone were laying on a wooden desk and it was on silent and it makes a chattering noise from the wood, but I don't use vibration cause I never have my phone on silent, so it wasn't a problem at all for me actually.I am a very satisfied customer and I recommend this to anyone, even if the iPhone 5 is out.

After further review on the 3 previous phones, here's my pros & cons about the iphones I've had:Pros- iPhone 4 has a nice sleek design, shaped flat on the back, as opposed to the last iphone I had which was rounded on the back- Faster than the last 2 iPhones I had (2G & 3G)- Fits most modern cases (Mine is the Ariza Imperial case which Amazon sells -Ariza Imperial iPhone 4 / 4S -Leaux Comfort Case with Genuine Leather -Gold / Black)- Great with the latest IOS- App Store, iTunes, Podcast, & Overall High QualityCons- Small Device vs most larger screens of today- No FREE MUSIC apps (Unless iPhone is jailbroken)- Less Free Apps than Android- Not an Android Phone :)Overall, I never had issues with my iPhone 4, but often dropped my phone due to my clumsiness, so I purchased an Ariza Imperial case to protect my phone and also look like a million bucks.Anyone interested, you can find this case hereAriza Imperial iPhone 4 / 4S -Leaux Comfort Case with Genuine Leather -Gold / BlackI loved my old iPhone 4 but I liked Android even better :)The iPhone 4 is great for those who like its style, but I am more into having a mini sized PC in my pocket with free apps and free music :)",5,"03 27, 2013",An Honest Review !!,Cell Phones,Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - CDMA Verizon,178,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 505},Apple,Cell_Phones,0.806109,0,0

B004ZLV5UE,1300406400,"I picked up the Verizon iPhone 4 on its release date and am very pleased with its performance so far.  Previously, I used a Droid Incredible, which was also a great phone.To preface this review, I am a light to moderate user that mostly uses the device for making phone calls, texting, checking email, and occasionally using internet and maps.  I'm not the type to sit around for hours playing games on my phone, nor have I ever streamed any video on my phone.  I have one ""official"" app on my iPhone that is related to the camera, and I don't use it to listen to music; I have a separate iPod for that (to save my phone's battery).The Verizon iPhone works great as a phone and has the best call quality in a smartphone that I have ever used.  This is in comparison to my previous Droid Incredible, a Blackberry Curve prior to that, and my friend's Motorola Droid.  The earpiece volume is crisp and sufficiently loud, making the other person easy to hear.  The microphone works well too based on what people I call tell me.  The visual voicemail system is phenomenal- it's all managed by the phone itself instead of through Verizon, so when a person gets your voicemail message, all they hear is your personalized recording without the ""at the tone, please record your message.  When you are finished recording..."" garbage.Texting and email work nicely.  The touch keyboard feels more natural than most other touch screens I've used on other mobile operating systems.  One strange thing about texts is that the phone will make a ""whoooop"" noise everytime you send a text.  There's no way to turn this sound off by itself without putting the entire phone in silent mode.  Not a big deal for me, but I can see how this would really annoy some people.Based on my personal experience and all the reviews floating around online, the camera is without question the highest quality camera you will find on any phone today because of an ideal blend of lens quality, the type of sensor, and a modest megapixel count.  Higher megapixels do not correlate with higher quality images; although there are many other phones out there in the 8+ megapixel range, none match the overall image quality of the iPhone.  The 8 MP camera on my Droid Incredible doesn't even come close.One thing I really miss from the Android OS is Google Navigation.  No turn-by-turn voice guided navigation software comes with the iPhone.  Apps are available that provide this feature, but they are inferior to Google's program.Battery life is excellent for this type of phone.  Most days with light to moderate use from 7 AM to midnight, I end the day with around 80% battery remaining.  Obviously, if you're a power user, it's gonna use more juice.  I'm particularly impressed with how little battery is used when the phone is on standby.  Battery life was my biggest gripe about Android (HTC phones tend to be notoriously bad at battery conservation), and it is a huge relief to not have to carry around a spare battery anymore.If you're considering converting to Apple from an Android phone, there are a few areas of frustration.  The notification system on the iPhone is archaic and unnecessarily intrusive.  Texts will pop up on the screen regardless of whatever you're doing, requiring you to exit whatever you're in the middle of to reply.  Android's notification system is excellent, and I am hoping this issue will be addressed in a later version of iOS.  Also, there is very little flexibility as far as how the phone is personalized to your tastes.  Not happy with the 6 text tones that Apple gives you?  Too bad- you're stuck.  There's no easy way to add more text tones.  A third issue- when using Safari mobile, there is no way to disable mobile view.  Sites like yahoo and banking sites will automatically funnel you to the mobile (crippled) version of their websites.  In Android, all you do is check a box to disable mobile view.  No such luck with iOS.Fortunately, there is a way around all of the above restrictions, provided you're a moderately intelligent person with a basic knowledge of computers.  This and any iPhone can be easily modified to fix all the problems I mentioned- just search online for instructions.The back glass plate seems to be fairly prone to collecting light scratches.  I had my last phone for 10 months with no case and no screen protector the entire time, and it never got a single scratch.  Since noticing the tiny scratches on the back of my iPhone, I bought a minimalistic case for it, and it's been fine since then.  Still no scratches on the front glass in 5 weeks of use so far, so I have no plans to ever use a screen protector.One last thing I'll mention:  there is not a single piece of Verizon bloatware on this phone, unlike every other smartphone I've owned that came installed with all the crap applications loaded on by the carrier that you can't remove.There are lots of good phones out there right now.  In my opinion, this one is the most polished, and despite some limitations, it provides the most satisfying overall user experience that is yet to be matched.

I carry my cell phone when driving or working outside for safety to call for help in event of an accident.  It uses Sprint service and there is good service within 50 miles radius of my home.Since I am on the edge of Verizon service in my area, this connection is weak.To use the dial features, I have to put on my reading glasses and make multiple swipes to make the IPhone call anybody. Siri does not work at all without excellent connection service so a major feature that might have worked is not available to me.Because of the poor reception area, the IPhone keeps searching all the time for a good signal.  This decreases the battery life to about 4 hours.It would be a great phone for someone in a city, who does not use reading glasses, accesses internet for sports scores and plays on-line games.

B004ZLV5UE,1404864000,"Almost 3 years old and it just works :)  Best phone I ever had.  I have had smart phones since they first came out 10+ years ago.  I always had insurance, and broke every phone at least once except this one.  I cancelled the insurance when I came up for renewal.  I do have a heavy duty Seidio case on the phone, which probably has helped as I probably drop the phone at least once pr week.  I felt compelled to share this as companies that make quality items should be recognized for fine craftsmanship.  I even have the original plug in headphones that still work, despite being plugged in and unplugged, being caught on things and yanked out of the phone etc...  Even the battery life is better than other phones I have had before after 2.5 years.  I do shut of the location finder, as well as I only check for email manually, which helps allot.The other thing is that I never upgraded the software and am running the original 6.0.1 which is was a smart move as it is not necessary for the apps that I have.  I heard from others that the newer operating system used more battery etc..Anyway, in this day of throw away mentality, where all things break, this phone along with the headset has shown itself to be a real winner.  I hope that Apple continues to create phones like this and that others will follow suit, and prioritize quality and longevity as that is the more responsible and economical way.Despite I think the new Samsungs are probably better in many ways.

Other people mentioned that their iPhone was stolen, fake, or used badly. This iPhone is brand new for $180.

Texts will pop up on the screen regardless of whatever you're doing, requiring you to exit whatever you're in the middle of to reply.  Android's notification system is excellent, and I am hoping this issue will be addressed in a later version of iOS.  Also, there is very little flexibility as far as how the phone is personalized to your tastes.  Not happy with the 6 text tones that Apple gives you?  Too bad- you're stuck.  There's no easy way to add more text tones.  A third issue- when using Safari mobile, there is no way to disable mobile view.  Sites like yahoo and banking sites will automatically funnel you to the mobile (crippled) version of their websites.  In Android, all you do is check a box to disable mobile view.  No such luck with iOS.Fortunately, there is a way around all of the above restrictions, provided you're a moderately intelligent person with a basic knowledge of computers.  This and any iPhone can be easily modified to fix all the problems I mentioned- just search online for instructions.The back glass plate seems to be fairly prone to collecting light scratches.  I had my last phone for 10 months with no case and no screen protector the entire time, and it never got a single scratch.  Since noticing the tiny scratches on the back of my iPhone, I bought a minimalistic case for it, and it's been fine since then.  Still no scratches on the front glass in 5 weeks of use so far, so I have no plans to ever use a screen protector.One last thing I'll mention:  there is not a single piece of Verizon bloatware on this phone, unlike every other smartphone I've owned that came installed with all the crap applications loaded on by the carrier that you can't remove.There are lots of good phones out there right now.  In my opinion, this one is the most polished, and despite some limitations, it provides the most satisfying overall user experience that is yet to be matched.

B004ZLV5UE,1353715200,Well the Rep of the iPhone speaks for itself;  and this purchase was hassle free as usual with Amazon and there vendors. Never had a Smart Phone so I went and started asking around at the Verizon store and they filled me in on all of these numbers I required to assure that the phone was legit and not stolen.  ANd I was so confused when we were done that I was sure glad that I decided to purchase my iPhone from Amazon because of the way that they stand behind each purchase.

I carry my cell phone when driving or working outside for safety to call for help in event of an accident.  It uses Sprint service and there is good service within 50 miles radius of my home.Since I am on the edge of Verizon service in my area, this connection is weak.To use the dial features, I have to put on my reading glasses and make multiple swipes to make the IPhone call anybody. Siri does not work at all without excellent connection service so a major feature that might have worked is not available to me.Because of the poor reception area, the IPhone keeps searching all the time for a good signal.  This decreases the battery life to about 4 hours.It would be a great phone for someone in a city, who does not use reading glasses, accesses internet for sports scores and plays on-line games.

B004ZLV5UE,1404864000,"Almost 3 years old and it just works :)  Best phone I ever had.  I have had smart phones since they first came out 10+ years ago.  I always had insurance, and broke every phone at least once except this one.  I cancelled the insurance when I came up for renewal.  I do have a heavy duty Seidio case on the phone, which probably has helped as I probably drop the phone at least once pr week.  I felt compelled to share this as companies that make quality items should be recognized for fine craftsmanship.  I even have the original plug in headphones that still work, despite being plugged in and unplugged, being caught on things and yanked out of the phone etc...  Even the battery life is better than other phones I have had before after 2.5 years.  I do shut of the location finder, as well as I only check for email manually, which helps allot.The other thing is that I never upgraded the software and am running the original 6.0.1 which is was a smart move as it is not necessary for the apps that I have.  I heard from others that the newer operating system used more battery etc..Anyway, in this day of throw away mentality, where all things break, this phone along with the headset has shown itself to be a real winner.  I hope that Apple continues to create phones like this and that others will follow suit, and prioritize quality and longevity as that is the more responsible and economical way.Despite I think the new Samsungs are probably better in many ways.

Other people mentioned that their iPhone was stolen, fake, or used badly. This iPhone is brand new for $180.

B004ZLV5UE,1362960000,"Choosing a smart phone seems like it should be an easy decision, right? But in fact it is not.  We have such a difficult time choosing what smart phone is right for us because there are so many styles and models to choose from. The two latest and most popular operating systems on the market are the Android designed by Google and iPhone is designed by Apple. For the past few years I was known to change my phone every 3 - 4 months. I was encouraged to switch to the iPhone due to the problems I was experiencing with the Android phones. Even though Android phones have bigger screen sizes iPhones have better quality, battery life and game selection.Screen Size:Android has a variety of screen sizes to choose from. Depending on manufacture, it ranges from 3.2"" to 4.3"". A larger screen comes in handy for surfing the web, viewing text heavy pages, and seeing a lot more detail in pictures and videos. iPhones have a much smaller screen than the Android phones and it makes it difficult to surf the web and scroll on screen.iPhones offers a simplicity and better quality than Android phones. I am able to pick up an iPhone and quickly understand what's going on. It has one main button on the front of the device and everything consists of tapping app icons from the home screen. However, Android has several buttons that perform a variety of functions. It has many possible home screens and ways of doing things from those screens that can get you confused easily. Android models are low quality and are made from plastic. One of the biggest problems I had with Android phones was that it would always freeze and I would always have to restart the phone.Apple phones have a longer lasting battery that will get you through your day without having to worry that it will die on you. With an iPhone you can manage what is running in the background with a push of a button. You decide whether to keep the apps open or closed them by holding down the home button. An iPhone can give you up to 8 hours of battery life, even when you watch videos, play games or even surf the internet. Due to Android's larger screens, their battery burns faster so you're going to have to carry your charger with you at all time to be able to charge it when it dies. The Android phone gives the user at least 4 hours of battery life.Games:An iPhone has a better game selection. Apple is a major player in the mobile video game market and it has a wide selection of free games to choose from. Android doesn't keep up with the updates of the free games. Android has good games but you have to pay for them. Some of the game companies have stopped making games for it all together.In conclusion each phone has its pros and cons; it just comes down to what you prefer in a phone. Switching over to an iPhone has been the best decision I've made when choosing a phone. Why choose an iPhone? iPhone gives the user what they need, better battery life, quality and game selection.",5,"03 11, 2013",iPhone is the best phone I've had,Cell Phones,Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - CDMA Verizon,178,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 505},Apple,Cell_Phones,0.144509,0.144509,0

B004ZLV5UE,1400371200,"I have recently gone back to the Iphone 4. It is still a fine phone even with all the newer Android phones, the only thing that doesn't stand the test of time is the size of the screen.LOOK & DESIGN (NOT SCREEN)The black Iphone 4 has a nice sleek look to it. It's smooth black casing that protects the inner battery and the camera, It helps protect the phone from drops also, the iphone 4 is very durable if you drop it screen side up. Screen side down is completely different story.SCREEN SIZEThe 4.5X2,3 inch screen is way to small now with all the phones out now. Some of the Windows and Android phones have screens the size of some of the smaller tablets. The screen is very clean,clear, but it is just tiny and isn't big enough to watch Netflix, play games, or watch youtube videos comfortably without straining your eyes.STORAGEThe Apple people know what they are doing. The fact that you can't have a SD card is ridiculous. You have to squeeze all of your games, music, apps, and photos in 16 Gigs. It is easy to do unless you have an extensive collection of music or movies. If you want more storage you have to buy the 32 gig or 64 gig Iphone. It gets annoying when the new IOS come out and you have to delete stuff just to download the new operating system for your phone.HOME SCREENThe start up screen has a very nice look to it. If you group all of your apps together you can do anything directly from the start up screen like call your mom, play pandora, start itunes, check your calender, search the internet. It is a very user friendly interface and didn't take me long to figure out all of the in's and out's of the Iphone $.BATTERY LIFEAlong with the screen size this might be the thing that iphone fans complain about the most. If you are playing a lot of games your battery will last you 4-6 hours before you need to plus it in. What is the point of having to be tethered to your charger? Sure it could last all day if you only use your phone for random google searches or the occasional itunes song. Most people don't do that, at some point their phone gets a lot of use and it drains there battery pretty quickly.

B004ZLV5UE,1377475200,"May 6, 2012.I recently switched from a HTC Desire (Google Android) to an iPhone 4S, and I have finally got to experience what the fuss is all about. Firstly it's a beautiful phone, both externally, and in terms of interface. Everything is gorgeous, smooth moving, and clean looking. The interface never becomes jerky or slow, unlike with my Desire, and although that sounds like a minor thing, it actually makes a huge amount of difference: Just using the phone is enjoyable, everything feels really ""solid"".The keyboard is also FAR improved to the one I had to suffer with for two years on my HTC Desire. I've only had my iPhone a few days and I'm already a fast typer than I ever was with that phone. Well done, Apple!That said, there are few things that my HTC Desire did better:1. The Desire came with an LED indicator that would flash green if I had any updates. That meant that I could glance at my phone across the room and see if I had any texts, missed calls, emails, Facebook updates, etc. It was very handy. The iPhone 4S has a feature to use its flash in a similar manner, but it actually only flashes the instant you receive a text or email. Then it stops, meaning it's pretty useless.2. The Desire came with a way to control the cursor. The ""home"" button on that phone also detected finger movement. If I was typing something and I wanted to go back a few characters, I could just move my thumb across it, and control the flashing cursor between the letters. It was extremely useful and I find myself trying to do it on the iPhone. Unfortunately on the iPhone all you can do is hold your finger on the screen and drag the cursor to where you want it to be (you also had this option on the Desire, but I never used it because the other way was far more efficient). It's a little glitchy and a lot slower. Shame.3. When I wanted to search the internet for something with my HTC Desire, I could just press the ""Search"" button on the case. It was quick and intuitive. On the iPhone it's astonishingly laborious: You must go into the web browser and select the ""Google"" bar on the top right hand corner of the screen. It's not THAT bad, however, because there's a shortcut that allows you to zip up to the top of the screen.4. Although the scrolling is wonderfully smooth on the iPhone (certainly smoother than the Desire was), it's a lot slower. On my Desire I could ""flick"" the screen with my finger and it would keep scrolling on its own, with its own inertia (it would eventually slow down depending on how fast I had ""flicked"" it). This was fantastic when all you want to do is check for new comments on a blog post. You could quickly and easily scroll down to the bottom of a page, without any finger strain.On the iPhone the scrolling stops soon after you let go, making navigating long pages a very arduous experience indeed.5. On top of the lack of an LED indicator, the iPhone is also lacking with regards to keeping you informed of updates. On my HTC Desire there would be an icon at the top of the screen, no matter what I was doing, letting me know if I had any updates. A different icon for each update: An email, a text message, a missed call, a Facebook update, a new Twitter message, etc.On the iPhone you get informed, but then it's gone. It's hard to explain how this isn't as good as the Android equivalent, and I understand that it probably sounds minor to those who have never used an Android phone.Update: I've actually gotten used the Apple way of doing things, so while it may jar for those who move across, chances are you'll adapt like I have.6. One of the best Apps on the Android is a free one called ""FoxyRing"". It has a terrible name, but it's brilliant: It automatically adjusts your ring/notification volume for you, depending on the loudness of the ambient sound around you. Just walked into a Library? It will turn the volume down for you. In the middle of a gig? It will turn it up for you. All done automatically. You can also set it so that your phone automatically goes to silent at a given time, every evening (say 11pm) and goes back to normal (i.e. automatically adjusting your volume) at 8am. In other words, I never had to worry about my phone's volume, it was just taken care of.Sadly Apple do not allow Apps to have this sort of control, and they don't have the equivalent system built in to their OS. It's a real shame because I think it will eventually become standard in the future for people not to have to worry about their phone's volume.Anyways, this is a minor concern, because a lot of people won't have that particular App.So ultimately, while there are flaws with this phone, they don't ruin the experience. It's a little shocking to me, as a new user, that Apple has seen fit to focus their attention on gimmicks like ""Siri"" (I don't know anyone who really makes use of it), when there are could be some great improvements made to the interface.Would I go back to an Android? Nope. At least, not right now. The experience on the iPhone, however frustratingly idiosyncratic at times, is still an enjoyable one. The little graphical touches, the slickness of the presentation, and the simplicity of use, all make it really satisfying. After the many quirks of my Android phone, it's really nice to have a phone ""that just works"". It may not do exactly what you want it to do, but what it does do, it does extremely well.Final note: Be prepared to spend a bit extra on a case and/or screen protector. Not only is the iPhone notoriously fragile and prone to smashing if dropped (I know about five people with cracked screens), it's also pretty slippery in your hand compared to other phones. A rubber case will make it less likely to take a tumble out of your hand, and a screen protector will keep that glass screen scratch free. It's an unfortunate hidden cost, in my opinion.Additional note: If you're an Android user, you may also be shocked to discover how lacklustre Apple's support for Facebook and GMail are. Both of these apps are not as good as their Android counterparts at the time of writing, and there's no way to ""link"" phone numbers to Facebook accounts. Another annoying, but minor, quirk of the iPhone to be aware of.",4,"08 26, 2013","Recently switched from Android: iPhone is wonderful, but has flaws.",Cell Phones,Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - CDMA Verizon,178,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 505},Apple,Cell_Phones,-0.00179627,-0.000598757,-0.001197513

B004ZLV5UE,1311552000,"I purchased my Verizon iPhone 4 the day that it launched. I wasn't expecting any surprises considering that Verizon released it well after the AT&T; launch. In this regard I was correct. My model shipped with IOS 4.0 installed and that was very fun. The feature that makes this phone great compared to the competition is the Operating System. IOS is the best system available for a smart phone. I've owned 3 Android Phones and 3 iPhones. The iPhone is definitely the best of the bunch and I don't expect that I will be going back to a Droid anytime soon. The build quality of the iPhone 4 is superb. The glass resists scratches and the iPhone 4 has glass on both the back and front (compared to previous iPhone models and the iPod Touch). This leaves it very resistant to scratches. All of my Android Phones scratched easily.The iPhone 4 is weak in a few areas. The volume isn't as loud as it was on my Android phones (especially the Droid Incredible). I would rate the actual sound quality as high and the volume as average. The Wireless is hit-and-miss at best. Apple used the same Broadcom wireless module that is found in the iPad and iPod Touch. This module is a very low-power device which translates into low range. It's not uncommon for the iPhone to struggle with picking up Networks that other devices can see easily. The iPhone 4 lacks a SD Card Slot and thus cannot be upgraded. The Battery is also built-in and will have to be replaced by Apple if it fails. The iPhone relies on iTunes for syncing media which can be a pain if you're not a big iTunes user. The Camera takes amazing pictures... as long as the subject isn't moving. There is a noticeable delay in taking motion pictures. The Video Quality however is fantastic.Overall the Verizon iPhone 4 is a great addition to the Apple Library and deserves 4 stars. It does have a few downsides, but the enjoyment that you will get out of it will make you forget them. I would highly recommend this phone to anyone that enjoys Apple Devices.",4,"07 25, 2011",The best iPhone yet!,Cell Phones,Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - CDMA Verizon,178,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 505},Apple,Cell_Phones,0.174128,0.174128,0

B004ZLV5UE,1400371200,"First off, I have had one of these models for a couple years. I love the quality of my iPhone 4 but hate being under contact, which is why I wanted to get the same phone for my two daughters but without the 2 year obligation. Verizon is doing a $25 per line discount on non-contract smartphones right now too. It is a great deal that can pay for an outright device purchase quickly unless you wind up using a lot of data.This review is not for the iPhone 4, but for the seller I dealt with through Amazon Prime, and for Amazon itself.The purchase I made was entirely misrepresented. Neither of these iPhone 4s were new as claimed by Trans Tech Products & sold as new by Amazon Prime.Both iPhones purchased looked pretty good cosmetically and had a clean MEID that could be activated through Verizon without problems, but both serial numbers had previous Apple registration & expired warranties. There was non-standard packaging on both phones (incl. replaced back and front scratch protector stickers with hair and dust stuck under them, carefully lifted but tampered external box seals and info tags, replaced wrappers and twist ties on wires, and a metal SIM insert holder in the rather dogeared welcome material enclosure, on a SIM-free Verizon CDMA phone). Both phones were missing the standard dot moisture sensors in headphone jacks and plug, which my local MacXpert said meant the phones had almost assuredly been opened, either for service or part replacement. Their absence would usually void any warranty on the phone. Although wiped of personal information, each phone had an updated operating system and many applications open when I powered them on. They immediately displayed the lock screen instead of the set-up assistant wizard. Clearly they were pre-owned.I am not adverse to buying a refurbished or well cared-for used device at a decent price, but I paid Trans Tech Products a premium for these iPhones based on the &#34;New&#34; claim, thinking I would also get the manufacturer's warranty. When I contacted Amazon about this issue, I indicated a willingness to keep the devices at a fair used price. They immediately agreed to refund to me the difference between what I had paid initially and what a used iPhone 4 is now selling for on Amazon, about half the nearly $200 &#34;New&#34; list price charged by Trans Tech Products.This sort of dishonest and misleading listing made under the umbrella of Amazon Prime really damages the trust of the consumer, regardless of whether Amazon is almost always willing to make it right through return and refund or not. This corporate &#34;honesty&#34; unfairly depends on the critical attention and a high degree of product knowledge on the part of the purchaser. If I buy something claimed as NEW and sold by such an established retailer as Amazon, I should be able to trust that it will delivered as 100% new in every aspect without exception. Amazon needs to do a more careful job of vetting their sellers, especially the ones they allow to sell under the Amazon Prime listing.",1,"05 18, 2014",iPhone 4 NOT NEW as claimed by seller Trans Tech Products and listed under Amazon Prime,Cell Phones,Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - CDMA Verizon,178,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 505},Apple,Cell_Phones,0.00270194,0.001501078,0.001200862

B004ZLV5UE,1355529600,"I own an Android device and top-notch PC but unfortunately have to try and operate and troubleshoot iPhones and iPods for family members.  Android devices are very user friendly but iPhones - they're just unfriendly.  It seems that they are constantly sending you to the iTunes or app store to buy more more and more.  I recently tried to copy purchases from one iPod3 to an iPod4 and found their website full of incomplete instructions on how to do this.  So I went into one of the trendy Apple Stores in the mall and learned that their stores are not infact full of customers - but Apple product owners in for technical support on their malfunctioning or misbehaving products!  The youngster who help me was impatient - definitely not as helpful as the Verizon Experience store folks helping me with my Android.  And while it might seem I'm reviewing Apple in general and not the phone, please bear in mind that if you buy an iPhone you too will have to deal with the unhelpful iTunes website, Apple's useless technical support and their tendency to sell you more products rather than access and enjoy what you've already bought from them.  Not to mention I just bought a camcorder and found several reviewers disappointed that their Apple computers won't recognise the best image output from their camcorders - this is because Apple wants you to buy Apple Video Editing programs.  So remember, once you start going down the Apple road, things become unfriendly with Apple blocking access to many features of your non-Apple tech products (I don't know any other tech line that does this).  As for the iPhone4 - I honestly recommend you compare it with the best Android device and see which will allow you to move 'your' purchases amongst your devices most easily.",1,"12 15, 2012","Awkward, unfriendly, ads-galore",Cell Phones,Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - CDMA Verizon,178,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 505},Apple,Cell_Phones,-0.463465,0,-0.463465

I have found myself using my phone to not only maintain personal work-orders while at work, but also keeping inventory and track of how much of products I have on hand at multiple buildings and being able to scan items in inventory, and scan them out of inventory by using the camera....It takes High Def video and photos so I definitely cannot complain about that. And because everything in it is solid state, nearly everything you do is instantaneous. Simplicity is the way of Apple, and if you can't figure something out it's usually because it's simpler than what you thought it would be.One must if you buy this phone is to get a case from a company called Lifeproof [...], these cases will make your iPhone water-proof, dirt-proof, snow-proof, and shock-proof... and I mean you can literally take your phone into the water WITH YOU.... a definite must, and nearly unbeatable ruggedness compared to cases offered for other phones.People say Apple is over-rated, but I switched from PC to Mac back in 2006 and I will NEVER go back to a Windows based product (This is from a PC Technician)",5,"08 10, 2011","When you see the Apple, guarenteed a great product.",Cell Phones,Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - CDMA Verizon,178,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 505},Apple,Cell_Phones,0.621946,0,0.621946

But let's face it: Apple Products rock!Not everything is perfect; I have issues with the Apple TV, but am still waiting to see the hobby device become something serious.But the iPhone 4S lives up to its promise in many ways.If I could advise you on one thing about this phone it's this: get as much space as you can afford. Yes there is iCloud, but it's not even close to it's potential. Also, if you're like me and use streaming music services, you'll want the space for travelling without a network (like on a plane). Not to mention all of the beautiful pictures you'll take with the awesome camera this has built in! I do not take my standalone digital camera with me anymore. It just doesn't compare. And, bonus, my pics automagically get shoved up into iCloud so I can share them with all of my other Mac devices (yes including the Apple TV). Siri is in beta, but just about every time I talk to her, she really hears me and puts down my words in writing.The other thing about the iPhone that most folks don't know is that the software running it is alot older than you think. Sure the interface itself (where you touch the screen) is all new. But underneath it all is an Operating System built from the Mac OS X bits and pieces that are matured from as long ago as 1993. I know because I worked with that OS (NeXTStep) back then (both as a developer and user).I see Android devices catching up, but I'm confident that Apple will just leapfrog over whatever they put out. In the meantime, I have a phone that does everything I want, with a consistent look and feel and the elegance of a well thought out and designed operating system.Now as far as Verizon goes. Yes, it's still 3G. If you don't like that, wait for the iPhone 5, it'll be LTE by then. It actually doesn't bother me that much. I also grab wifi when I'm in a stable place. But out and about I've rarely noticed a loss of data nor dropped phone calls. I can't say I could compare this to AT&T; or any other carrier for that matter as this is my first iPhone 4(S).If you're thinking about this phone, can afford the voice and data plan, just get the most amount of space you can afford and you can't go wrong.",5,"07 19, 2012","Steve Jobs is God!

The abundance of apps is great and the quality of the phone overall is superb.The battery life blew all my other phones out of the water.  The picture is crystal clear and the sound that comes out of the phone isn't bad.  It's better than my other phones (Samsung Glyde, Samsung Reality) but it's certainly not great. Call reception is great on Verizon, I've never had a dropped call and I get service where a lot of other cell users do not.My only qualms is that it doesn't support 4G and not all apps on the app store free or that great, but this is not the fault of the phone.Now that the iPhone 5 is out the iPhone 4 seems more reasonably priced and remains almost as great as the 5.

The only bad thing I have to say about the iPhone is that if you're using it frequently during the day, it'll only last about 24 hours, so I have to charge it every night. But that's not really a problem for me because I've always done that. I just plug it in right before I go to bed. Apps are easy to download, ringtones are clearer and crisper than on any other phone I've had, and it's true what they say: If you have a need for it, there's an app for that! Apps are also very easy to erase if you don't like them. It's also very nice that I can turn my phone sideways when sending a text and the keypad gets a little bigger (I have big fingers), so I don't mess up my typing as much. It didn't come with an instruction manual per se, just a little pamphlet thing that told me about a few things that it does. It was fun to figure the phone out as I used it. I haven't had ANY problems with it (I've had it for a little over two months) and I'm so glad I purchased this phone!

I've been using my spare phone for a few days after my Droid 2 crashed so I was so excited to get this phone. The packaging left more to be desired but the phone is in dang near perfect condition, looked brand new! It was charged about 75% so I was able to activate it right away on my prepaid service without any problems. I've been using it all day since 3PM & all seems to be fine. Only minor issue, which I hope don't turn in to a big issue is that sometimes, there is a lag in the response on the touch screen. I don't know if that's how all phones are as my Droids also lagged but I will keep an eye out in case it gets worse.SUMMARY: I received a great product, exactly as described.

B004ZLV5UE,1387670400,"I got the same phone from version store. I had it for about a year now so I think it marrets a review. This phone is pretty dependable when making calls. I never dropped a call on my end so far. I'm on 3G now thogh I don't know why they don't update mine to 4G.The 16 GB HDD is pretty spacious. I'm able to hold 150 songs and around 120 apps and I still have lots of room to maneuver. The memory and CPU helps it run very well. Most apps never crash on me compared to android apps like google which now crashes all the time on android market in my experience. The battery is pretty good if you take care of it. Charge it when it's at 20% and don't try to charge it overnight and use a 5 volt charger as much as you can. If you take care of the battery it can last almost two days without charging it.The 3G network does have problems sometimes because it occasionally switches from 3G to 1X which is a pain in the ASS sometimes like when I try to use the GPS or brouse the web. It even switches from 3G to 1X even with international CDMA turned off. the newest IOS 7 doesn't look as good as IOS 6. IOS 6 looked more professional. In IOS 7 the apps are more cartoony which I don't really like but whatever. Another thing I don't like is how the slide down menue is on the bottom of the lock screen which is annoying because I end up activating the slide down menue instead of unlocking the phone.Over all I still love it. I don't think I'm upgrading for a while because it's still good to me Apple in my opinion rushed the 5, 5c and 5S. The iPhone 4S to me still feels like a top of the line. I forgot to mention the 8 megapixel camera! It's great to. Pictures come out beautifully if you allow it time to adjust to light and focus and photos don't take up allot of HDD space. Also there is a small flaw in the speaker when watching YouTube videos. The YouTube audio seems to play through the ear piece next to whe webcam instead of the bottom speakers like its supposed to and I've tried everything I can to try to fix it so I might need to take it to apple or version store to find out why it does that.",4,"12 22, 2013",Great phone but there are some problems,Cell Phones,Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - CDMA Verizon,178,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 505},Apple,Cell_Phones,-0.149034,0,0

B004ZLV5UE,1310169600,"The Apple iPhone 4 is one of Verizon's best all around smartphones.  While it no longer sets the pace in the smartphone realm, the iPhone 4 does an adequate job of handling nearly all basic smartphone tasks and offers well rounded performance; which is all that many smartphone users really want from their device.  While it is not for everyone, and no device is, the iPhone 4 is a solid device and is definitely worth a look for non-power smartphone users.1. Design.1. The compact and svelte design of the iPhone 4 is refreshing, as the smartphone ecosystem continues to evolve from ""brick"" to ""cinder block"" sized phones.  It is slim and pocketable, and the side keys are arranged in an intuitive manner.  Volume keys and the power button (which doubles as a screen lock) are very tactile, and the ring/vibrate toggle on the top left side of the phone is a great addition.  While the phone's physical appearance is subject to personal taste, i'd wager few would find the phone unattractive.  I have the white version of the phone, and find it much more vibrant and visibly appealing than the more unassuming black version, though some may find the white to be too loud on the eyes.2. Despite the phone's relatively small size compared to other smartphones, there's a bit too much wasted space on the front of the phone for my liking.  While the screen is clear and bright (there is no pixelation whatsoever due to the 960x640 resolution), it's a tad small when considering the width and length of the device.  In fairness, problems due to the screen's size are more a product of the operating system and not the physical dimensions of the screen, but the OS also has no relation to empty space on the phone's front face.3. Both the front and rear facing camera's are flush with the phone's design, which is a big plus.  Apple also hit the correct layout for the charging/data port and the 3.5 mm headset jack; the former is located on the bottom of the phone, while the latter is at the top.  Several phones i've used (feature and smart, and from almost every manufacturer) had the headset port on the bottom, which is fine if you like to hold your phone upside down all the time, and also featured charging ports in the middle of the left or right side of the phone.  If Apple changes anything about the physical design of the next iPhone, these two items should not up for discussion.4. One thing that should be up for discussion however, is the back of the phone: it is made out of glass.  Many iPhone 4 users lament this, but Steve Jobs didn't amass a fortune by mistake.  The more people that drop the phone and break the glass on the back, the more money Apple makes.  It's a design flaw, even if it was intentional.Performance1. Calls: I tested the iPhone 4 on Verizon's network in a variety of locations across Louisiana.  Call quality has been very good; I have not encountered any dropouts or conversational blips during any call.  Callers do not sound overly warm through the earpiece, but they do not sound robotic either.  Callers also sounded good through the included headset and on three different bluetooth headsets I tried, but speakerphone quality was abysmal at best.  The speakerphone is not loud enough and suffers from ""the wax paper effect.""2. Reception: the iPhone 4 gets above average reception on Verizon's network; like many Verizon phones, I generally have 3-4 bars nearly everywhere I travel.  It rarely has full signal but I haven't dropped below two bars either.3. Battery Life: the battery will take you through a day of heavy usage and two days of light usage.  Phone calls use surprisingly little power, and I only lose 2-3% of juice while the phone is on standby during the night.4. Data Speeds: While this varies from location to location, I find that the iPhone 4 isn't as quick in this regard as other phone's i've used, particularly Blackberry and Android devices.  Depending on the location, I generally get about 10-20% slower speeds on average with the iPhone 4.  In fairness, I've observed the same with my fiancee's iPhone 4 on At&t;, so it's not a carrier issue.  Regardless, I haven't had any problems loading large webpages, streaming audio and video, and moving files.  In the two areas I spend the most of my time in, my download speeds range from 0.6 to 1.4 MB, and my upload from 0.5 to 0.8 MB, which is normal for many Verizon phones in many locations.  With that being said, it is clear that Verizon's 3G network is slowly clogging up, which i'm hoping the influx of 4G upgrades and devices will address.  Despite these notations, Verizon's 3G network is far more consistent in terms of speed and connection than other carriers in the area. My fiancee's iPhone 4 on At&t; ranges anywhere from 150 KB to 3 MB down and 50 KB to 1 MB up, and even though At&t; theoretically has a faster 3G network than Verizon, my data connection seems far more reliable.Features:1. Operating System: After using several smartphones with different operating systems, i've concluded they are all more or less the same with a few differences here and there: tap an icon on the screen and go.  Up front, I don't find the iPhone 4's OS any easier or harder to use than Android, RIM, WebOS, and Windows Phone 7, and I also don't buy into the idea that iOS is simpler and easier to use than those offered by its competitors.  There are a few differences here and there; Android offers widgets, Blackberry offers a few home screen icons and a drop down menu, and Apple offers...a convoluted mess of icons and programs with little rhyme or reason.  It's simple to use, but that does not mean it is always pleasant.  A drop down menu would do wonders for this OS.  Personally, I miss the widgets than Android and Windows Mobile offer, but I understand Apple cannot become too much like its competitors (well, maybe not until OS 5).  However, there is little organization going on when you first fire up the screen.Where iOS really begins to look like every other OS is when you delve deeper into the menu.  Again, there is little rhyme or reason to how anything is arranged, and for a couple of weeks until you memorize where every option is located, it can be a frustrating experience.  My favorite example was browser settings; you cannot access them from the browser, but only from the overall settings menu itself.  Is this any better or worse than other OS?  No.  Is it any easier though?  Well, no again.A final side note: iOS does not require ""babysitting"" and constant attention like Android does in order to get your battery through the day.  I know rooting solves many of Android's babysitting issues, but a lot of people have jobs, families, and other hobbies that make rooting an unnecessary annoyance.  While I personally like Android OS better for the customization it offers, the entire babysitting/rooting issue is a turn off to some, and I myself don't miss them either (even though I never had a problem rooting an Android device).2. Business functions: Apple does not have the business reputation of RIM or even Android yet, but nothing from my usage suggests it is inferior to either OS in this regard.  Push e-mail works like a charm, Exchange works as it should, and Office files along with PDF's open and render as they should.  I am not a power business user and cannot offer comment on such, but the iPhone 4 gets the basics down in this category.3. Multimedia: This is a big of a mixed bag for me.  The iPhone's 4 camera is one of the best i've ever used on a smartphone; both the rear and front facing.  Though the rear camera is only 5MP, images are clear, sharp, and beautiful as long as there is adequate light.  Night shots with flash were less than stellar, which should surprise no one with a smartphone.  The front facing camera is only 1.3 MP, but still takes images with little distortion.  Beyond this, i'm not blown away with the iPhone 4's multimedia capabilities.  iTunes integrates files nicely with the phone, but i'm not sold that Apple's ecosystem is any better than dragging and dropping.  The iPod is perhaps the most underwhelming feature on the phone; I find it no different or more impressive than any other smartphone music player on any other device.  And the speakerphone performed no more impressively for music and video playback than it did for voice calls; multimedia audio sounded waxed over and washed out on the speaker. The AppStore will only impress those migrating from RIM, WM7, and WebOS.  But one thing I've noticed about using applications on the iPhone 4 is that they don't seem to crash nearly as often as they do on Android and Blackberry, and in fact, I don't think i've had even a handful of them in a month's usage.  And the lack of Flash does not seem to be a hindrance on the phone's multimedia capabilities; QuickTime handles things well, and the YouTube app helps too.  Again, multimedia is a mixed bag on the iPhone 4, but that's more a knock on the hype the device receives rather than the device itself.Conclusion:Other than subtle differences in the OS, the iPhone 4 offers the same similar features that many other smartphones offer.  It does a good job of handling core functions and basic business needs, and its multimedia package is somewhat overblown, yet still more than adequate.  If your looking for a mid sized smartphone that requires little maintenance and don't need LTE services, the iPhone 4 is definitely worth a look.  For the price however, it offers few features that stand apart from any of the other top smartphones in Verizon's lineup.",4,"07 9, 2011",iPhone 4: A Good Smartphone With Many Similar Companions,Cell Phones,Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - CDMA Verizon,178,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 505},Apple,Cell_Phones,-0.0997326,-0.0332442,-0.0664884

The 3G is easy to burn through your data plan but that's with all 2010 up smart phones.  Battery runs out every two days if you use it regularly.  1/2 a day if your a text-addict ( like every body if the world).  But again every smart phone 2010 up runs through batteries.

B004ZLYBMI,1375920000,"So I was waiting for what seemed like an eternally long time to get the white iPhone 4 after the black one came out because apple couldn't figure out how to properly place the ambient light sensor, but that aside, I love this phone. Apple continues to be the leading manufacturer in consumer electronics, especially the phone industry. This phone shipped with iOS 4.0, and Apple's still taking it with them to iOS 7, and that's awesome. With a 5 MegaPixel camera sensor, and an autofocus lens with flash, and 720p Video @ 24 fps, Photo quality is beautiful. Yes, it does lag a little bit when I have a lot of background apps running, and when they're gone, the Phone feels as good as new even with all the extraneous apps I've packed into it. Every time I turn it on I smile to myself at how beautiful this thing is, and how nice it feels in your hand. Yes, from the outside it might look like it might be uncomfortable to hold seeing it has not smooth or curved edges, but actually the stainless steel antenna/band provides both a tapered design element, and a grip for both large and small hands. The glass on this phone surpasses the entire device except for the little strip of steel running all the way around, and that adds a sort of ambience to it when you look at it. Also, the battery life is amazing. I easily use this for up to 24 hours while just calling, texting, checking my feeds, and watching the occasional YouTube video. This phone is a great buy, and is just another Apple miracle.",5,"08 8, 2013",Brilliant phone!,Cell Phones,Apple iPhone 4 16GB (White) - AT&amp;T,259.95,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 5427},Apple,Cell_Phones,0.479244,0.239622,0.239622

B004ZLYBQ4,1326585600,"I love this phone. And I'm not an Apple fanboy, I've owned Androids and I've owned feature phones. Each have their pros and cons. Here's my list of likes and dislikes:Like:Reliable. I can count on this phone to not crash, restart, or otherwise fail. I turn it off once every few days, just so it gets reset every so often. I've never HAD to, though. It runs fluidly and smoothly, as intended. My Android didn't fare as well, with crashes and restarts as much as twice a day.Fast. Apps load and switch seamlessly. Camera loads in a second, so I can snap that shot before it passes.Battery. It literally lasts about 2 days with moderate use, if I didn't play on it so much I wouldn't doubt it'd last 3 days. It's fantastic to not worry about power management or if I have my charger with me.Camera: Shutter speed is fast, flash is bright, shots are clear and crisp. Video is 720p. Very nice!Apps: An app for every occasion. I have games, a news app, flashlight, social networking, skype, GPS, etc. It's awesome.iOS: It's great. The new notification pull-down is so convenient. It basically copied the Android version (for once!) and it executed it well.Dislikes:Not much. Not as open as Android. Jailbreaking helps.No notification light. It would be nice to have an LED to let you know when you have a notification.No 4G. It's becoming more and more mainstream, but when this phone came out only Sprint had 4G so it's not too big a deal.I would HIGHLY recommend this phone, or the 4S, which is basically the same with a little better processor and camera, and Siri. It never fails to disappoint me.",5,"01 15, 2012","Reliable, simple, and feature packed!",Cell Phones,Apple iPhone 4 16GB (White) - Verizon,180,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 711},Apple,Cell_Phones,0.118966,0,0
B004ZLYBQ4,1390867200,When buying an iPhone online it is way important that the description said clean esn and that it was scratch free and as a seller that you had a high ratting for the past product that you have sold.Some of the other phones that I looked at did not say if they had clean esn or not. So that is why I went with your phone over the others.,5,"01 28, 2014",Great phone,Cell Phones,Apple iPhone 4 16GB (White) - Verizon,180,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 711},Apple,Cell_Phones,-0.202606,0,0
B004ZLYBQ4,1322179200,"I've been using the iPhone 4 (Verizon) for about a month now.  Prior, I had an HTC Droid Incredible for 2 years and before that, a Blackberry Curve--so my vantage point for comparing the iPhone to other smartphones is pretty good.First APPEARANCE...  the phone is sleek and beautiful.  The materials Apple used for this phone put all of my previous phones to shame.  They now feel cheap, like a dumpy car next to a Lexus.  KEYBOARD: the phone has an excellent virtual keyboard--much better than the Androids.  But, of course, there's nothing like an actual QUERTY keyboard.  On the iPhone 4, I can type quickly and accurately most of the time.  It doesn't have a built in mouse (like my Droid Incredible did), so you have less control of the cursor's position, but there is something wonderful about the screen that I can't describe.  The auto-correct is also incredibly intuitive at fixing typos.  WEB BROWSING: excellent but equal to the android.  APP STORE: Apple charges for many of the applications that Android gives away for free, but the App Store has a nice selection and most of the apps work well.  With the Android App Store, you sometimes get apps that totally don't work or force-close all the time.  CUSTOMIZATION: yes, it's true--the Android gives you a zillion times more control over customizing your phone.  For 2 years, I goofed around with all the layout options.  And now, after one month of having a pretty fixed iPhone setup, I've come to the following conclusion.  ""Who cares?!""  The iPhone has such a nice and easy-to-use layout that there's really not much need to change it around.  BATTERY LIFE: It's not bad.  If you keep the Location services shut off and close down applications when not in use, the battery can give you a decent run for your money.  Battery life on this phone is much better than what I've experienced with the Andriod.  (Also, Apple recently sent a battery-life fix to all iPhone4/4S users and I've definitely seen improvement.)  With this phone, I don't feel overly pressured to conserve the battery.  CALL/VOICE QUALITY: No distortion or breaking up.  My phone hasn't dropped any calls and the signal strength has been slightly better than on my Android.Now, some of the cons...  This phone's screen seems much more likley to break if dropped on it's face.  If you're a clutz, get the Otterbox or another super protective case.  The volume for the phone's different functions is not very customizable. Meaning, you can't make your ringer loud and email notification soft.  They're linked together.  I find this annoying b/c I'd prefer to keep my ringer volume up at night in case of an emergency.  However, I'd rather not be woken up by email notifications.  Another small con, the phone's comfort on the ear is mediocre.  (My old phone felt better.)  Also, the grip isn't excellent.  It's not slipping and sliding like a soapy dish, but the grip could have a better feel.  I suppose Apple was more concerned with the sleek shape when designing the phone.In conclusion, I really like the iPhone 4 and recommend it.  So far, it hasn't given me a single problem.  However, if you're crossing enemy lines from an Android, the iPhone does take some getting used to.  For my first 2 weeks , I complained nonstop about every single thing the iPhone couldn't do (like live wallpaper or landscape mode on some applications)--but then I started appreciating its beauty and simplicity.  Today, I'm really happy to be an iPhone 4 user.

I have had some pretty bad luck with the Android line of phones, so I thought I had nothing to lose by buying an iPhone. The phone fit seamlessly into my media lifestyle. It gets great reception, on Verizon anyway; can't speak for other carries. The phone it replaced only got 1-2 cell bars anyplace in our house, in fact, sometimes it was roaming in our house. This phone is routinely on 5 bars, only occasionally dropping to 4 bars. The only thing about this phone that bugs me a little is that it's so small. The on screen buttons are sometimes hard to hit, and I have small hands. Overall, I think I'd probably buy another one when the iPhone 6, or whatever, comes out next. Solid buy!UPDATE!Had the phone for 3 1/2 months and it died today. Brought it to an Apple store and they opened it and told me it was a bad refurbished phone that I purchased. Upon opening it they discovered that the items used for the refurb weren't Apple products. A lot of 3rd party products. The serial number was taken off of it, but Apple managed to find out that the previous owner of my 'new phone' had run the handset out of warranty in 2011 and that handset was then used to upgrade to a new one for that owner and I am the proud recipient of a seriously bad refurbished phone. Buyer beware! You get what you pay for, and there's a reason that Apple sells them for 1 price and why you get such a reduced price on on these handsets - they're refurbished and sold as new!",1,"04 24, 2013",LOVE IT! / HATE IT!,Cell Phones,Apple iPhone 4 16GB (White) - Verizon,180,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 711},Apple,Cell_Phones,-0.227746,0,-0.227746

Supposedly Siri is in beta and I expect really great things from her when the real version is finished. Apple accomplished a formidible task when they developed an AI-based voice recognition system that works with natural language as opposed to numerous competitor's requirements to remember an assortment of code words like ""dial"" and ""call."" If someone tells you that Siri isn't revolutionary, don't believe them.The only weak point as far as my personal (reasonably heavy) use is concerned is battery life.

B004ZLV5VS,1390780800,"it's not the &#34;be all and end all&#34; device that Apple zealots would have you believe.This has been my first apple device, and it's certainly adequate.  It's not bad, but it's not light-years ahead of other devices either.It's not without bugs or quirks.  Most outstanding:  it has problems with DHCP with my wifi-cable modem where I need to turn wifi on the phone off and then on again in order to get traffic flowing again.  This need has revealed another quirk where, on occassion, Wifi will *not* turn off.  Sometimes the slider (on-off switch) bounces back to the &#34;on&#34; position.  Sometimes it looks like it turns off, but when I go back to the main settings screen and then return to the wifi settings screen, the wifi switch is back on again.  In this situation, I go through a cycle of turning wifi off 3 - 8 times before it actually remains off.Text entry is simply uninspired.  For all Apple's much bally-hewed design talents, they certainly didn't waste any cleverness surging beyond a basic keyboard.  The phone's auto-complete feature is nice, but I had better auto-completion on a Palm V over 10 years ago.  I pine for T9 to accelerate text entry.Built-in email is well integrated & supports multiple accounts.  Build-in calendar is less versatile.Speaker phone is adequate, but I've had better from cheaper phones.Oh, and if you only want to use wifi-sourced data on your phone & avoid data plan fees, iPhones work perfectly fine without a data plan.At the risk of stating the obvious:  if you don't have a data plan, you don't get google maps, email, etc. when you're out-of-range of a wifi network.  For me, this is fine.  The carriers categorize text messaging as non-data, so you can pay for that if you like.Sure, without data you take a hit on certain (& very few) phone features; the most significant & least obvious, I'd say, would be the log of outstanding voicemails the iPhone can show you.-- Without data, you just get an indicator that you have voicemail to be listened to.-- With data, you get an inventory of who left you voicemails at what times.***All*** iPhone apps have settings to enable/disable data transfer over the phone network.  The phone also has a &#34;master&#34; setting for this, too.DO NOT let Verizon, Sprint, etc. tell you that a data plan is necessary to operate one of these on their networks.  It's simply not so, and -- unless they've changed their tunes in the past 2 years -- they will not tell you this.  Verizon & Sprint (and probably all other carriers) will make you get a data plan to have one of these on their network, and they won't tell you anything different.  When I've asked them, they've been unequivocal on this requirement.  Their justification for this is completely bogus; namely that smart phones need data to operate.I've learned, however, of 2 ways to get around this requirement.1 - get a pay-as-you-go account2 - piggy back your iPhone on an account with someone else's iPhone that has a data plan.(in my case, my wife's work pays for her phone & plan; I piggy-back on the account, but don't use data.",4,"01 27, 2014","nice phone, but....",Cell Phones,Apple iPhone 4 32GB (Black) - Verizon,204.95,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 1949},Apple,Cell_Phones,-0.101781,0,0

People have strong feelings about their cell phones it seems but when it comes down to usability, simplicity and just 'working' pretty much all of the time, still no one does it better than Apple and the iPhone.I know you can customize the Droids more here and there, I know there's no widgets, no this and no that. But there's also more security, more safety, more updates that roll out to everyone as soon as they're ready, more people using an iPhone 4 who still get to use pretty much the same features as the iPhone 5 because the software is available for both phones at the same time.The app selection is better, the best apps come out for iPhone first and the screen is great now that they've put the whole 'Retina Display' thing out there, the only real negative is the screen size, which in today's world, should really be bigger than 3.5&#34;.

B003U6628A,1295654400,"Story in short ->1. The first moment I see this stunning beauty iPhone 4: I said WOW! I am totally in disbelief mode how one can make so beautiful thing. I am in total love with the lady.2. After living with this lady for some days: How could God (Apple) create so beautiful with ugliest heart!!! I mean beauty is sometime very deceptive but not that much.3. I am still in love with this stunningly beautiful lady: I return first iPhone 4 and try another iPhone 4. Still hoping for best.4. I got same replica of this lady. (God cannot create the exact replica of most beautiful things but Apple can)5. After living with this lady only for few days: I am more than happy to part my ways with this stunning beauty. Let me tell you, in my whole life I have never been so happy to part my ways with so beautiful lady.6. Now I am in totally hate of this lady to the extent I even don't want to the face of this lady. I say: Hey Beautiful lady please go back to Apple's beautiful store, museum or in REEL life (MOVIE). You have no place in my REAL life.Interested in full version of the story? Please go head and read.My first review ever (FYI I am 35+ of age and bought many products). I have never written any review for any product so far. THE SOLE PURPOSE OF WRITING THIS REVIEW IS TO SAVE YOU YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY. SO HERE GOES THE ONE OF MOST HONEST REVIEW OF THE GREAT IPHONE 4 WITHOUT BEING MESMERIZED BY THE SHEER BEAUTY OF THE PHONE.SO READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU DO CARE OF YOUR MONEY ELSE YOU ARE MORE THAN WELCOME TO BUY IPHONE 4 AND HAVE YOUR EXPERIENCE OF YOUR OWN.I received my iPhone 4 almost 17 days back from AT&T; on 12th Oct 2010. From the first day itself it started showing me all of its true colors.Pros:1. As everybody says great display (Retina display).2. Great and simple and nearly perfect touch user interface.3. Hands down the most beautiful phone with best built and finishing.4. 5MP HD camera.Cons:1. `ANTENNAGATE' -> From the moment we started using it we had that notorious 'antenna' problem. Everybody including us so much pissed with the voice quality suffered because of this issue that we preferred not to talk at all. Sometime the voice was so low at both ends that it was not audible at all. Even after putting the bumper on the phone did not solve the problem entirely. Sometime though rare we noticed the above antenna symptoms again. I PROUDLY SAY ""I WAS ABLE TO PRODUCE THIS PROBLEM ON ALL FOUR IPHONE 4 I HAD COME ACROSS"". ON ALL THE IPHONES THE SIGNAL BARS WENT TO 2 FROM 4-5. Many videos can be found on youtube.com for the same (JUST CHECK THEM OUT THEY WILL FEEL YOU GREAT HORROR MOVIES IPHONE 4 BEAUTY LOVERS). This issue was not blown out of proportion as against what Steve Job's claimed.There are some very important things to note here about this so called `most appreciated company' Apple and one of its best product iPhone4:(i) SEE THE CHANGING COLORS OF APPLE/APPLE CEO STEVE JOBS:(First) No such problem ->(Second) Not that big problem ->(Third) Others are having the same problem (Did you hear it before? Or at least others don't give trouble when you hold them in your normal style) ->(Fourth) Take the bumper ->(Fifth) Avoid holding in that position.Apple CEO Steve Jobs said `avoid holding that way'. Apple Please tell us why should customer amend their `normal' way of holding the phone that too after having paid so much price? Instead should not Apple should have taken the moral responsibility of this mistake and recalled it?Apple/Steve should be ashamed of when they asked to asked customer to change the way of holding the phone. But how Steve could do that? Then he will no longer be the best CEO of the so called best company? (It would have incurred the loss right?) Most ridiculous asking so far I guess. Why there should be any restriction on the most basic thing `holding the phone'. It's like one electronic switch company saying please press the button in certain way else ...'(ii) This antenna problem comes into the play when most of the right handed people hold the phone their most natural way. It seems that so big and quality conscious company has even failed to do even a simple usability and quality testing. Shame on you Apple!2. BATTERY -> Battery would run only for 24 hours at max without using battery consuming features. So all claims of this many hours for standby, video, internet etc. looks false.3. TURNED OFF ITSELF -> On 17th day my iPhone 4 turned it off on its own though it was fully charged.4. NO ADOBE FLASH SUPPORT -> Though `Adobe flash' is universal standard for web this iPhone 4 still does not support it. Great Mr. stubborn Apple!5. SPEAKER VOICE NOT GREAT -> Speaker voice not that loud and not acceptable for this so called great smart phone. Many Other phones outperform iPhone 4 in this area.6. VERY POOR SIGNAL RECEPTION AND CALL QUALITY -> Call voice quality average and not that great what one would expect from this phone. MY BLACKBERRY CURVE 8310 WITH THE SAME ATT NETWORK WOULD WORK EVEN IN UNDERGROUND PATH STATION AND THIS GREAT IPHONE 4 DOES NOT EVEN WORK INSIDE WALMART WHICH IS QUITE OPEN WITH THE SAME ATT NETWORK. POOREST SIGNAL RECEPTION. THE T-MOBILE NETWORK WITH THE BASIC PHONE (WHICH I USED TO HATE A LOT EARLIER) SEEMS WORK BETTER THANKS TO IPHONE 4. SO IN SHORT THE WORST COMBO IS WORKING BETTER WHEN COMPARED TO BEST COMBO (ATT AND IPHONE 4)Another couple shared the same thing with me. They told me that Blackberry Torch with worst network (T-Mobile) was having better reception than the dead combination iPhone and ATT.7. BAD 3G EXPERIENCE -> I noticed couple of other things with respect to 3G. When I keep 3G and cellular data on, the signal bars are very low where regular network is giving full bars and I was not able to access the web at all even in prime city locations. Not sure whose problem it is: Apple or service provider.Once I turned the cell data on and the bar became from four to one and then zero, after that my iPhone went into Searching mode forever though I turned off the cell data plan. As usual I restarted the phone and it worked. Looks like another bug in phone's simple functionality.8. BEAUTY IS ONLY SKIN DEEP -> This iPhone's beauty is only skin deep. Beautiful by looks only not by heart (features). If you compare it with a woman then I would say its most beautiful woman but with HIV. So you can do whatever with this stunning lady but those basic things (you know what I mean right?)9. THE LADY WITH HIV LIKES TO BE TOUCHED AGAIN AND AGAIN -> This lady with HIV will work only when you touch it, thanks to the touch interface of it. So if want turn off the phone press the button then touch (slide). You want to turn it on; press the button and touch (slide the finger on it). Want to make a call? Touch the phone application icon and then type the number (forget the good old days when you just touch either number key or call button and you could do it). Done with you call and want to finish the call? Don't forget to touch the end button. ENOUGH?10. EXPLOITING CONSUMERS -> Like other companies (Earlier Microsoft for example) Apple also started using malpractices and exploiting the situation because this company is now in command. Some examples :(i) AV component cable you have to buy from Apple only. Other's cables do not work. Now imagine the price of Apple's AV component cable: $49. That's almost 1/10 of the price of the phone itself.(ii) The iPhone cannot be (or as easily) unlocked as other phones.(iii) I heard if you unlock the iPhone the other's carrier's SIM does not go that well (May be because of its unlocking through software not through hardware).(IV) ON ATT AND APPLE WEB SITE YOU WILL NOT FIND ANY REVIEW OF THIS GREAT IPHONE 4. REASON: APPLE CANNOT MAKE ANYTHING LESS THAN GREAT! (HA HA HA)SUMMARY: THIS IPHONE 4 IS EVERYTHING ELSE BUT CELL PHONE. PLEASE SPEND YOU MONEY ON SOMETHING WORTH AND MAKE SURE AT LEAST YOU ARE GETTING WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THAT IS A CELL PHONE AT LEAST WITH GOOD RECEPTION AND CALL QUALITY.Question to all of you ->Now I ask you all, the phone which cannot even offer you basic things well, what you would call it smart phone? There is one car with all kind of luxuries: AC, pool, TV and whatever you can imagine but it does not drive well. The engine gives some trouble after every two hours. Will you buy that car? Are you going to live in that car? First thing for any vehicle obviously is smooth driving right? Same way most important thing for any cell phone is good signals and good voice quality. This phone lacks in those basic things. Apple, you have to get those basic things right. So when consumer reports did not suggest this phone to consumers they were absolutely right.I am not that happy with this phone.Update on 6th Nov 2010 ->I tried my second iPhone 4 after returning the first. The experience is getting worse about this iPhone 4 and I have decided to return the phone. ATT exchanged my first iPhone4 with already returned by other customer (Looks like other than me there was one more wise guy in this world who returned this phone). Shame on ATT who charged me the price of new piece and sent me the refurbished one.Bye Bye the great beautiful iPhone 4, Please go back to Apple Beautiful store or museum or in REEL life (movie) , you have no place in my REAL life or pocket which is looking for just a decent usable cell phone.Update on 25th Nov 2010 ->I returned the second iPhone 4 also and start using my other spare $9 phone. CAN YOU BELIEVE $9 phone is working better in terms of voice and reception quality.SINCERE ADVICE ->->-> Please wait for next iPhone. This iPhone 4 really sucks. Apple had become very over-confident when they release iPhone 4, because they know there are many BEAUTY BLIND people who would buy this DUMB BEAUTY without even reading review for it even though they had to stand in the QUEUE.",2,"01 22, 2011","Not that Smart, Its beauty is only skin deep!

B003U6628A,1330646400,"Im on my 2nd iPhone 4, to me this device captures  all of what an phone should be, and strive to be. It's beautiful design of reinforced glass, the minimalistic feel and premium quality make this device a cut above the rest. Great camera, great music integration, fantastic clarity of the screen, and to me it's best quality is its size.I'm president of the fat finger club! I have big hands, and even with a 3.5' screen, I can hit each letter on the keyboard with amazing accuracy. I don't have anything against other phone makers who love putting out 4.3-5.3 inch screens. To each there own-for me, the iPhone hits the perfect size.Pros: music, apps, browser, email, display, auto correct, keyboard, iOS platform, video playback, camera, multi-tasking, size of the device.Cons: it might be reinforced glass, it's still glass, the antenna, and the home button. Never was a fan of the home button, mainly because after a while, it'll start to stick, or you have to keep repeatedly pressing it.To anyone who hasn't yet bought a smart phone, and is thinking about buying one, I recommend the iPhone. There isn't a very steep learning curve, in fact, you'll learn the device inside a few hours.And to anyone who wants to upgrade to the 4s, I've played with one, of you have a 4, stay with it til the 5 comes out, if you have a 3GS or 3G its well worth it to upgrade.Remember, the iPhone 4 is first and foremost a phone, so don't get it if you aren't in a good coverage area, because the antenna really isn't as good as phones like the droid razr, or phones from htc, they build phones with great cellular radios.",5,"03 2, 2012",iPhone 4 review,Cell Phones,Apple iPhone 4 Black Smartphone 16GB (AT&amp;T),332.99,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 5478},Apple,Cell_Phones,0.533134,0.533134,0
B003U6628A,1333497600,"Unfortunately, I had a bad experience with this purchase.The phone I received looked good but acted seriously weird, never a good combo.The apple store genius bar opened up the phone and discovered traces of liquid damage, explaining the problems.  There and then, they offered me a replacement phone (at a discount, but not for free obviously) which I bought, having no alternative phone.  The apple store took the defective phone i.e., I couldn't return it to Amazon/this seller.  Subsequently, I filed a claim with Amazon, which they denied because I couldn't return the item.  Never did they actually contact me to ask for more info f.ex., apple store receipt.  Neither did the seller even though there was some communication about refund.  Well, that's an easy way out for something called 'a-z guarantee program'.Conclusions:- I would not recommend buying used electronics items from this seller as it doesn't seem the testing they may be doing is foolproof- I would not recommend buying used electronics items from amazon except if you know the seller to be 100% trustworthy",1,"04 4, 2012",Unfortunate experience,Cell Phones,Apple iPhone 4 Black Smartphone 16GB (AT&amp;T),332.99,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 5478},Apple,Cell_Phones,-0.399403,0,-0.399403
B003U6628A,1332374400,"I bought this phone a few weeks back refurbished from Pasha Electronics (one of the available sellers) for about $350 plus shipping. It came very quickly via USPS and AT&T; had no problems porting everything from my old iPhone 3G to said iPhone 4. The condition it was in when it arrived was very good, only one minor shallow scratch near the bottom right corner. The audio was crisp. Even the signal seemed to be better when the phone was configured properly. However, I'm giving this item, well, the seller really, 2 out of 5 stars because they sent me a phone with faulty connectors on its logic board. The rear camera would not initialize no matter what I did meaning that the virtual shutter would not open no matter how long you waited for it. I tried everything to get it working again. Apps that didn't use the shutter, on and off tricks, force quitting, hard reset, a couple of complete device restores, everything short of completely wiping the phone and starting from an empty shell, even buying 2 new rear camera units and switching both out for the original unit that came in the phone, still nothing! And the high end sharp optics rear camera was one of the major reasons why I bought this phone in the first place! So I eventually had to go into the Apple Store and get the phone replaced with a completely new phone for another $150 due to there being no warranty on the refurbed unit I bought from Pasha Electronics. I'm upset and annoyed that I ended up having to pay more in order to correct the seller's simple mistake of not testing the devices (which should have been Apple Certified Refurbished by the way; they are not when you buy from this seller) to ensure that they are in proper working order before they ship them out to their customers, which would've taken only about an extra 5 minutes to do.Long story short, DO NOT BUY FROM PASHA ELECTRONICS!

B003U6628A,1336348800,"As our economy grows, newer and more advanced technology is presented all over the world.  The most common piece of technology that excites and gets people reaching for their wallets are cell phones; or as we now call them, smart phones.  In the past cell phones were only used to make calls on the go; now there used for texting, surfing the web, and work/business.According to reviews and sales charts the phone that was considered to be the best for texting, surfing, the web, and business/work is the ""iPhone"".  The iPhone was produced by Apple and is pretty much their best seller.  I myself once had an iPhone, but like many ""iPhone lovers"" out there I'm not really a fan.  I actually prefer its nemesis the ""Android"".  I prefer the Android over the iPhone because of the iPhone's small design, the pricy apps, and the lack of flash support.Don't get me wrong the iPhone has a beautiful design but just isn't for me.  The main thing I look for in a phone is the size, but that's something the iPhone lacks.  It displays a 3.5"" screen while my Android (The Droid Bionic) displays a 4.3"" screen.  Pretty big difference huh?  The iPhones size makes it difficult for me for me to hold onto , forgetting to mention its too sleek, and glassy design.  This just makes the phone slippery and even harder to hold on.  Due to the screen size only being 3.5"" it makes it harder for me to stream videos and surf the web.  Don't get me wrong, the graphics are beautiful, but so are the Androids; plus the bigger screen which makes it even better.  I am constantly streaming videos and surfing the web so that's a two thumbs up for me.Another reason I don't like the iPhone is because of the pricey apps.  There are tons of apps to go through, but a lot of them you have to pay for.  You can find the same apps on the Android and get them for free.  The apps are also a little more complicated to use on the iPhone.  For example when downloading an app or purchasing one you would always have to enter your email address and password.  Why the hassle?  On the Android you simply search, click download, and within seconds your app is ready to use.  Another example of an app on the iPhone I find complicated to use is the music downloading apps.  Searching and downloading music on the iPhone is really complicated.  Once you find an app that actually allows you to download music, the first thing the app does is direct you to a music downloading site like ""BeeMp3.com"".  Then once you find the song you want and download it the song wouldn't even appear in your ""music folder"".  You'd have to find it somewhere in your files, which can get very frustrating.  On the android there are music apps that you can download that let you download from its own source and not a random website.  After a song is downloaded it actually appears in your music library making things way easier.Lack of Flash support is another reason why I prefer the Android over the iPhone. To some it isn't really a big deal, but to me personally it is.  As I said before I am constantly surfing the web and streaming videos, but without flash you can't really do that.  75% of video on the web is run by flash.  Although, there is an explanation of why there is no flash in the iPhone and Apple products.  As stated by one of the co-founders of apple, Steve Jobs,""Although Flash has recently added support for H.264, the video on almost all Flash websites currently requires an older generation decoder that is not implemented in mobile chips and must be run in software. The difference is striking: on an iPhone, for example, H.264 videos play for up to 10 hours, while videos decoded in software play for less than 5 hours before the battery is fully drained.""I guess the main reason for there being no flash is so that iPhones and other Apple products will have a longer battery life and from my experiences that statement is true all the way.The iPhone is not my favorite smart phone, but definitely is still one of the best smart phones out there.  The design is flawless, covered with alluminosilicate glass that is said to be 20 times stiffer then plastic and 30 times harder then plastic.  The apps don't really fit my needs, but still there are millions of apps to go through that fit other iPhone user's needs.  Although there is no flash support in the iPhone the longer lasting battery is there to back it up, so you are able to enjoy your iPhone without worrying about the battery dying.  As you can see, the iPhone is a great phone, but personally I'd still prefer the Android because of the much bigger display, the millions of FREE apps to search through, and the use of flash support.",3,"05 7, 2012",iphone 4 vs android,Cell Phones,Apple iPhone 4 Black Smartphone 16GB (AT&amp;T),332.99,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 5478},Apple,Cell_Phones,0.0338182,0,0.0338182

B003U6628A,1309910400,"Below is my review of the 16GB model that I purchased in September. Please note that this is strictly my opinion of the phone itself, I have no knowledge of this seller or the condition of the phones they sell.I had the 8GB 3G model and thought that was great, until I got a demo of the iPhone 4. Man is this version is light years ahead of the original model.With a 1Ghz CPU, and 16GB of flash memory, this thing is a portable office/entertainment center par excellence. I've had this phone for 3 months without a single problem, the display is nice and sharp, the apps load very fast, and I now have over 130 apps to perform just about every duty you could possibly think of with absolutely no impact on performance. And on the ATT 3G network, I average download speeds of around 1.8Mbps, and over 1M upload speeds....and how do I know that, cause I got an app that tells me that's how. BTW, the display is the equivalent of a 960x640 on your desktop (double the 3G model) so what you see is essentially a high res yield and page loads are superfast. And resident memory, after a full days use I just checked and still had 120Mb of Ram available. On the 3G model that number was usually down around 4Mb by the end of the work day and had to be refreshed.I was in the computer/design/manufacturing business for 20 years, and this is by far the most amazing piece of technology I have ever seen or imagined. Even the battery life is 3x better than the previous model, and thats a good thing cause its integrated but a full charge should yield and entire days work of calls, emails, surfing the web, SMS messaging, and play. I no longer need my laptop cause there's nothing I cant do with the iPhone, and that includes sending faxes, editing Excel or Word documents, and even printing. A flash for the 5MP camera, an HD video camera, and even real time video conferencing over a wireless network, and Bluetooth that unlike the 3G model is actually compatible with everything you throw at it, including Garmin GPS....just amazing. This thing even has 2 mics with noise suppression so calls are clearer on the other end. Man, Apple hit this one out of the park.BTW, with all the apps, music, and videos I've got loaded on this thing I've still got 10GB of flash memory remaining. I cant imagine why anybody would need more storage, and the 32GB model isn't any faster and doesn't have any more features. You'll need iTunes on your desktop to get the most out of this phone and iTunes can be a little intimidating at first but its worth the trouble, and all the instruction you need can be found on the web or Youtube for transferring photos, videos, music, apps, etc.Update 12/09/10: I've been reading up on the ""antenna problem"" with the iPhone 4G and have this to say.... It is easily cured by slapping on a hard case or shell on the phone, which eliminates the issue I see some people complaining about. I have personally never experienced this issue because I left the AT&T; store with a protective shell on my phone which virtually everybody I've ever seen with an iPhone has anyway. Very simply you CANNOT replicate the reported ""death grip"" problem with a shell around the outer frame. Cant be done. And BTW, I don't know if its due to network improvements or what but lately I'm getting 4Mbps download speeds so if anything I'm happier with my purchase now than I was 4 months ago. Zero complaints, and that's something most smartphone users of other OEM products can't say.Apparently this phone from Worldwide Distributors is LOCKED, according to other reviewers on Amazon. If you plan to use this phone outside AT&T;'s network you may have a problem. A word of advise is to contact these sellers with all your questions re: status of the phone, new or refurbs, return policy, warranty, etc before buying. Most of the one star reviews on Amazon are from idiots that paid $800 for this phone without doing proper due diligence.A final word: Beware negative reviews on here that are filled with bad English and are authored by individuals who have written only one review (on the iPhone) and posted it in several locations on Amazon's site. Its easy to pick these out, and they have no doubt been written by the same person. See the comments section for a definitive review on the Iphone 4 and the overblown ""antenna issue"" from Anandtech.comOh wait, I do have one complaint about the iPhone 4.

B003DZERC6,1305244800,"I bought this phone here because at the time it was $30 cheaper than what T-Mobile wanted non-contract.  When I got it, I put my SIM card in.  Calling worked fine, but I couldn't get the data service to work.  After talking to many different people at T-Mobile (with several different answers), I concluded that the right answer was that the unlocked phone wasn't allowed by the network to use the data services (at least not 3G services).  Thankfully Amazon allowed me to return this phone and T-Mobile was willing to cut their price some since I had to buy it from them and wasn't happy about it.Regarding the phone itself, it's a decent inexpensive smart phone.  I still use it today (nearly a year later).  The screen is small compared to more expensive phones.  The touch screen actions are at times inconsistent (but you learn how to use it).  It manages my gmail accounts nicely (though it can only be set to auto retrieve at most 2 accounts).  You can do basic web browsing to get information you need.  You wouldn't want to use it all the time or you would go insane due to the small screen.  Speed is okay with 3G, painful with Edge (roughly equal to dial up).  But the basic browsing capability has come in handy several times.  Also, the remote lock and wipe features are nice ever needed.The biggest drawback is the Symbian OS.

It has all the features you would want in a phone -- excellent camera, super-fast GPS and mapping features, very large storage capacity, etc.  The only negatives are a relatively short battery life (it must be fully charged every day) and confusing offers from Nokia, charging for downloads that don't appear and which, it turns out, aren't compatible for this particular model.  But that's Nokia's doing, not Amazon's, and really, the apps I tried to add would have been fun, not necessary.  I'm very pleased with the phone and thrilled that it was unlocked.

B003DZERC6,1326067200,"I physically sigh when I realise it's that time of year again where I have to upgrade to another cellphone. I feel like these days it's as important a decision as re-mortgaging. It seems that every other day there is a new cellphone with new capabilities and I end up feeling like an over the hill and out of date old fogey than the 30 something that I am.Mr E is frequently breaking and destroying cellphones due to the fact he works on building sites and I have therefore only got friends and work colleagues to keep updated about what is in and hip (Christ almighty did I just say that?). So after realising that 90% of the people I know are plugged into the latest I-Phone or smart phone which I seem to have some phobia about, I realised I was on my own.Is my cellphone smart?Now I am by no means stupid but sometimes I feel like I don't know what cellphone companies are harping on about. After a bit of research I discovered that a smart phone is exactly that, smart. They seem to have more capabilities as `normal' phones and many of them have added features such as touch screen, social networking and media players. I knew that an I-Phone was a no no for me and to be truthful I was sceptical about getting a touch screen at all but relented when I say this Nokia 5230. I have always liked Nokia as they are pretty simple and easy to use. I figured that I could upgrade with no cost to me (always a bonus) and that I would manage to get some nifty little features in addition to this.The BasicsThe Nokia 5230 is a reasonable size at 111 x 51 x 15 mm and weighs in at only 115 grams. This for me is the perfect size, not too light and little that I lose it, and nowhere near brick proportions. The screen itself is pretty big too (360 x 640) and it is a quad band phone meaning you can use the phone on most continents. It's actually a smart looking phone and comes in both black and white although the covers are not interchangeable.MusicThere seems to be quite a lot of features available for the music player side of this phone although I admit I don't use it. You can have dedicated music keys and can playback MP3, MP4, AAC, eAAC and WMA file formats. There is also an FM radio (always handy when you run out of something to read). Nokia also comes pre-loaded with Nokia Ovi Player which again I can't comment on as I haven't used it.Camera/VideoAs always it seems that cameras and video quality gets better the more cellphones get released. This Nokia has a 2 megapixel camera with 3x digital zoom as well as a photo editor built in. The picture quality is very good with the few limited photos that I have taken. It certainly won't replace my usual camera but is handy when you are out and about and haven't brought your camera with you. The video recorder is 640 x 480 pixels and up to 30 fps (with a TV of high quality) and decreases for the type of output you are using. The video also has the added bonus of both automatic and night scenes as well as colour tones of normal, black and white, vivid and negative.Web BrowsingIt seems that it doesn't matter where you are or what you are doing you have to have the capability to access the internet, at least that what it seems like. This phone has the usual web support mark up languages of HTML, XHTML and WML. It also has a Nokia search and surprisingly integrated GPS. There are also some handy shortcuts already set on your home menu for links to the likes of Facebook and Ebay. I have used it very occasionally and can't complain at any aspect of it. It was very straightforward to use and the download speeds were pretty good too.MenuThe Menu screen is easy to change to whatever style you like. You can choose to have a screen full of little shortcut widgets or a list, or like me have nothing but a small shortcut bar at the bottom of your favourite or most used add-ons. Like nearly all Nokia's the menus are easy to navigate with basic menu choices such as; Calendar, Internet, Contacts, Call Log, Messaging, Gallery, Music, Settings, Applications and Help.MessagingThe messaging side is again straightforward although it takes some getting used to having a touch screen rather than hard keys. Thankfully the screen is big enough that even those less nimble than others should be able to manage a text message. You also have the capability to set up, send and receive email.Other BitsWell you have a memory card slot so you can essentially use a storage card to increase its memory should you want to use it more for music or photos. It has Bluetooth version 2, a micro USB connector, flight mode feature, automatic switching between GSM bands, integrated hands-free speakerphone, vibrating alert and probably many more which I have forgotten to mentionThe Drop TestIn my house it makes no difference how great the capability it, or how many features there are. The most important things are that it stands the test of time in a home where cellphones are just that, cellphones. Neither me nor my husband care what the extras are, they are merely there for killing time if we are bored. Essentially cellphones have to live up to the drop test (and with a husband who is averaging 8 phones a year it's quite important). I have had the phone for nearly three months and so far it has survived the following.Test 1: Being dropped over the balcony in my block of apartments (I live on the top floor) and whilst I was trying and failing to open the front door. It dropped two floors hitting the banisters on the way down but miraculously had not a mark on it?Test 2: My husband being slightly worse for wear and stepping on it in work boots. Small scratch on the back of the case but otherwise unharmed.Test 3: Whilst throwing a ball to hubby at soccer on a Sunday morning I inadvertently threw my cellphone too so a football boot at high velocity managed to meet my cellphone unexpectedly! The phone gained another scratch at the side of the phone, but no marks otherwise.NegativesIf I am being honest I had to actually try and think of some. I can truly only think of one and that is that when you send a text message you have to touch type the text and instead of there being a direct `send' button you have to go to the options choice at the bottom of the screen and choose from the menu to send it. Aside from this there have been no issues with it at all.OverallOkay so you can all see I am certainly not one for judging a cellphone by its capabilities more by its practicalities. In this sense the phone is perfect. I get great reception; texting is easy as is taking photos. It certainly stands up to the durability test which is a godsend for me and in addition to this the battery life is outstanding. I think for a free upgrade cellphone I have ended up with a smart looking and durable phone that I think would have most accessories to please the majority of people.",5,"01 9, 2012",It's been practically Drop Kicked and still looks new,Cell Phones,Nokia 5230 Quad-band GSM Cell Phone - Unlocked,174.44,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 174454},Nokia,Cell_Phones,0.259014,0.222012,0.037002

B003DZERC6,1292803200,"I have had this phone since the the beginning of May 2010. It started ok for a cheap smartphone and Nokia sent a software upgrade around the beginning of June. I thought this was a good sign with Nokia, since I liked their previous phones. But, I have not had a software upgrade since and the phone is way toooooooo buggy! First, do not store too much in memory, it cannot handle it and gets very slow. Then get used to your phone just freezining or turning itself off. It will even freeze in the middle of a phone call. Their are so many little pain-in-my-butt bugs, it drives me crazy now. They were not so bad in the beginning, but keep getting worse. Now, the radio... Sucks! They use a cheap IC and have the antenna built into the headset, so you MUST have the headset attached for the readio to work. I like the alarm clock on this. The only problem is you cannot snooze or stop the alarm clock when it is sideways. Other things will disappear when the phone is turned sideways, including that long text message you write. The touch display is very bad at responding. Sometimes you go nuts trying to get it to recognize your finger press or swipe. I hate the stupid camera, it really sucks and has no feature or no LED light for night shots. My old Motorola RIZR had a 2M camera and took far better shots and had a ton of features for it. The GPS is OK, when it does not freeze. I actually like this if it was not so slow and buggy, it is pretty accurate. Nokia needs to spend more time with writing good applications, most fall short of simple. The software is so slow and you need to use your finger nail to try and scroll. The menuing is awful and can be very confusing. You will get lost! You cannot even charge the stupid phone on your USB! What morons!!! I feel duped that I bought this. Save your money and buy something better, Nokia is not reliable for a smartphone and they do not support their software. This phone has a lot of potential, but Nokia has decided not to support the software and fix the frickin bugs and this, to me, is extremely important in my phone.

B003DZERC6,1287100800,"I really wanted to like this phone. The dealbreaker is that it doesn't support 3G on Tmobile network. It is roughly 3 times slower compared to an TM506 when downloading. On the product page if you look carefully, it does show that 3G is not supported on Tmobile. This should be emphasized more -- here in the US you basically have two options AT&T; and Tmobile, and if you have Tmobile you are pretty much out of luck.Hotmail ActiveSync -- Exchange implementation on this phone only partly supports hotmail activesync. After doing a software upgrade (which wasn't obvious) on the phone its hotmail email support is actually not bad. It synchronizes 2-way with your inbox and other folders. It also synchronizes with hotmail calendar, but only the main calendar, couldn't figure out how to synchronize with other calendars (like the birthday calendar). Contacts is the worst -- it didn't synchronize in my case. I probably had a couple of hundred contacts maybe that is the reason.There is also a nokia email app that supports multiple services which has a decent interface. I don't think it supports custom folders on hotmail though.I've read bad reviews about its touchscreen, but it is not too bad. It is no iPhone, but given it doesn't require an expensive data plan and its price, it is certainly perfectly fine.Browser seems to be working fine.Didn't have issues with GPS locking, it was pretty reasonable.

B003DZERC6,1305849600,"Just over a year ago, I got one of these for free with a two year contract with T-Mobile.  Fourteen months later, I'm still delighted.  It's no Iphone or Android, but as a platform for phone calls, texting, music, and GPS, it's been great.This is a basic smartphone using Nokia's symbian operating system. Using the internet or a PC, you can connect to Nokia's ""OVI Store"" to download apps, update map files, etc.  I basically just wanted a phone, but the non-smart phones seem to be falling behind, and the smart phone features are nice, even without a data plan. Small touches like a hidden off-screen touch point to launch the media player, smooth switching between portrait mode and landscape mode, and other nice interface design add up, and I have ended up really liking this.There are a few minor annoyances, but I can live with them. In particular, it's a pain that Nokia has a proprietary charging point instead of charging through the micro-USB port that Nokia uses for data connections. The contact book seems limited - you can only store 2 phone numbers per contact, which is a pain when someone has work, mobile and home numbers, and there is no way to assign personalized ring tones. Since it's a smart phone, those issues may be resolvable by getting the right apps, though. The biggest drawback is that there are nowhere NEAR the number of apps for this that you can get for an Android phone or i-phone, but you have to figure you get what you pay for. The phone is thicker than an i-phone and feels a little plasticy, but still fits fine in my pocket. (I invested in a screen protector to cut down on scratches).  I wish that it had wi-fi so that I could use the internet features when in hot spots.As a phone, it's great. Reception and call quality are as good as anything else I've used, and it works well with my Jawbone Icon bluetooth headpiece. Texting is also good - it only took me a day or so to get used to using the virtual qwerty keyboard with my fat fingers, and at this point I can type quickly with few or no misses. The phone defaults included vibration feedback when you type keys, but that was easy to turn off, and also has handwriting recognition. The music and video player is fine but hasn't blown me away. Like most phones, the camera is adequate for spur of the moment shots, but has no flash or optical focus, so I still carry my point and shoot if I think I may need photos.The nicest surprise is that this phone comes with OVI maps - a decent gps and routing program that is completely free.  You can download maps over the USB cable from your PC, so the map program works fine for a cheapskate like me who won't pay for data.I'm too cheap for a data plan, so I just have a phone plan plus texting.  (If I was getting data, I might spring for a used Iphone 3g or gs or an android platform).  There is no wifi, so I use the PC connection to load songs, maps, apps, and videos. Unfortunately, Nokia's OVI store will only download directly to phones over a data connection, so if I want apps, I need to get them from the non-nokia sites. (Grrr! Nokia could at least allow me to download the friken FREEWARE to my PC!)The screen is not as responsive as an i-phone, but is fine. Instead of a stylus, Nokia included a ""plectrum"" - a guitar pick thing that you can attach by a lanyard. I've left mine off and just use my fingers or the back of a pen. The scroll bars are occasionally hard to work with my fingers, but I usually get them by the second try.The phone can take up to 16 GB of memory, and includes a 4 GB chip, which is nice of Nokia and has been adequate so far. (Of course, if you want the street maps for the whole US, that costs 1.4 GB right there, so I may be upgrading my memory soon).All in all, I'm very pleased. The phone does what I want - makes calls, sends texts with a qwerty keyboard, and does a lot more. A great value for the price.Accessory recommendations: My favorite accessories so far have been:-Jawbone ERA Headset:  A pricey bluetooth earpiece, but awesome for those who aren't bothered by the fit issues.-SanDisk 16 GB microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-016G (Bulk Packaging): So that I can carry tons of music, video, and maps.-Accessory Combo For Nokia Nuron 5230: Screen protector, belt case, car charger, and silicone skin.-Rapid Travel Home Wall Charger (CLA) for Nokia Nuron 5230: The proprietary charging port is enough of a pain that I wanted a second charger for the office.-Black Mesh Gym Armband Case Cover for Apple iPhone: Originally bought for an iphone, but great for using this phone as an mp3 player/radio/etc while working out or mowing the lawn.",4,"05 20, 2011",Good phone if you can get it cheaply,Cell Phones,Nokia 5230 Quad-band GSM Cell Phone - Unlocked,174.44,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 174454},Nokia,Cell_Phones,0.22164,0.07388,0.14776
B003DZERC6,1394668800,"Have been considering upgrading these phones just because we HAVE had them 4 years but not sure I'm going to. We like good phones, these are good phones with smart enuf features. I think I'll run them until I see a better deal or they die.We got ours FREE on a buy one get one from T-mobile in May 2010, Amazon also had a 1c deal.Phone quality is fine, reception is fine, Ovi maps are great, surfing a little slow but who wants to use a cell phone little screen for very long anyway. Under the radar semi smart data plan for $10. Fits nicely in a pocket, looks good after 4 years of being in a black rubber case on mine, and a clear plastic case on my partner's. You are not going to be able to download many apps since Nokia is not supporting this anymore OR the Symbian operating system.Nice candy bar size is easy to run one handed, definitely washes out in the sun, a little heavy for their size but sturdy enough to have been dropped MULTIPLE times over 4 years. If you don't spend a lot of time on facebook, surfing etc etc and just want a phone that is a great phone, has great maps WITH voice commands for directions, decent speaker and loudspeaker, FM radio, and a good enuf virtual keypad that works surprisingly well, this may be your phone. Remember we got ours FREE four years ago, so got to believe there are better deals out there, even used.

B003DZERC6,1296086400,"I bought the unlocked Nokia 5230 in May 2010 and so far there have been no problems... until today. Let me tell you all about the good first.Great LCD screen.OviMaps is free; Ovimaps has saved us on long trips!Touch screen works well.Never had a problem with hearing someone or them hearing me.Speakerphone works well.Comes with a 4GB memory card.Not much phone memory.The non-butt-calling feature on the side is great (locking feature)The camera is adequate.The Facebook app that the phone comes with is fantastic; uploading pics is so easy!I was able to pop the SIM card out of my old phone and into this one, no problem. I have $5 texting and unlimited internet for $15 on AT&T.; Very reasonable.And the bad...Keyboard is a bit small; I always make mistakes typing, and many time I press a key but it doesn't register.A stylus is an option to buy, and would make using the keyboard a lot easier.The Ovi store needs more apps, though the free ones they do have are good (like Endomondo for exercising)Can't buy movies, which is a pity (but a blessing in disguise b/c I'd be using the phone ALL THE TIME)Battery life is good if the phone is the only thing used, but when you add in music and/or internet, the battery is drained and needs recharging within a day.Using the contacts is kind of a pain: if you have one contact with a home phone and cell phone saved, and then call them, the 5230 only shows that person's name (not if it was a call to their cell or home); this is a problem when using the ""Recently Called"" list to call that person again; you don't know if you're calling their home or cell.Double-tapping the touch screen is a must much of the time (that's the way it's supposed to work), but sometimes you can single-tap the screen; I still haven't figured out when I can single-tap.There's a limited amt of personalization for the home screen.The Help search feature on the phone could be more helpful (for example, if you search for ""phone memory,"" nothing is found).Some of the things I use all the time (like pairing a phone) are hard to find and there should be a shortcut or at least a feature to create a shortcut from your home screen.There are few accessories to be had for the phone, like an exercise pouch thingy (what are those armband phone things called?)There are definitely a few things that could be improved on the phone, and many of my ""bad"" items are nit-picky. Overall the phone is great for the money (I paid $125 with tax and shipping in May 2010). It sends and receives calls just fine, I can get to my email and Facebook, and I can text. It's small enough to fit in my pocket. It has a typical headphone jack (not the mini). I can get to the memory card easily and switch them out when I need to.But today while I was jogging and listening to tunes, the phone just stopped. In the middle of ""American Idiot,"" there was no more singing. When I looked at the phone, it went nuts on me - went to a blank screen, then there were lines in one corner of the screen, then it went back to normal, but lost the time and date. It was weird. I tried to shut off my phone, but it wouldn't shut down. I kept messing with it (turning it this way and that) and I finally got it to shut down. Phew! When I restarted it, the same thing happened. So I shut it down again and I took out the memory, reinserted it, and powered it back up. So far, so good. It's charging right now, but I'll find out more tomorrow when I play tunes again. Lame. I hope this was just a weird glitch. I googled this issue and it seems I'm not the only one having this problem, specifically with the 5230. From what I hear about smartphones (though this one isn't classified as a smartphone per AT&T;), things like this happen a lot. And I know other phones have issues with phone memory and having to restart the phone often, definitely more often than once every (how long has it been?) eight months.To sum, I'm happy with the phone. But just in case, I'm going to figure out if this phone has a one year warranty. :\ Hopefully it does.UPDATE: 1/29/2011 The phone has been working fine since the little glitch. It seems to be a little slow at times but nothing out of the ordinary and it doesn't last. I guess the reboot did the trick. Phew!UPDATE 9/4/2012 I just bought a replacement battery for this phone. All the functions on the phone are still working, so I thought I'd save a hundred bucks and keep the phone that's served me well over the past couple years. I really love this phone, esp the GPS function that works without data/wifi.  I couldn't find another phone that had the same functions without having to spend money on data.Nokia had updated their maps and programs, so I needed to upload new maps recently, which took an hour or so. That was kind of a pain, but it was a one-time thing and everything is working fine.I also have not had the issues with the screen anymore. I keep the phone locked when not in use, or in my pocket and that took care of the problem. (I really think the phone got ""confused"" when the orientation was switched back and forth too quickly over and over.)  Anyway, just wanted to let you know I still have the phone, and with a new battery, I am one happy camper.",4,"01 27, 2011",Great li'l phone for the money,Cell Phones,Nokia 5230 Quad-band GSM Cell Phone - Unlocked,174.44,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 174454},Nokia,Cell_Phones,-0.0968222,0,-0.0968222

It has any feature you could want except wifi but this phone is NOT considered a smartphone by AT&T; so you DO NOT HAVE TO PAY THE $30 DATA PLAN FEE and you can use the $10 per month unlimited data!!  I bought this phone for my husband because it seemed like the best alternative to an iPhone and similar touchscreen smartphones without the issue of having to pay the ridiculous ""Smartphone Plan"" fee. The camera works great even though it has no flash. You just set it to night mode and can get a better picture in low light settings. The internal data is plenty generous and you can also add an SD card for more memory. My husband particularly likes this because it means he can use it just like an iPod or any other MP3 player and it also has the built in radio so he can listen to it while at work (he is a residential/commercial remodeler) if he doesn't want to listen to his stored music. You can still answer calls right from the earbuds while using the radio feature. The touch screen is great, the screen size is great. It has fast response time from input or touch. We have absolutely no complaints at all.Some people might not like the idea of not having wifi, but if you think about it, if you buy any similar phone you're going to have to pay the stupid $30 extra monthly fee even if you do not use AT&T; internet.

Basically our TomTom device died and I didn't want to spend $150 to buy another GPS device and then have to deal with buying maps whenever I needed or so forth. This phone has GPS and costs the same so it is no brainer. Also, we have family overseas and we travel annually so it is handy to have a GPS device that covers the whole world and has so many languages for driving instructions. In addition, we can use the phone any time we travel as well - just swap a new SIM card.The phone's quality is good. There are some nuisances, but not important enough to make me dislike the phone. Voice quality is good. It doesn't have WiFi and some people are put off by it. But you get what you paid for. Nokia has dozens other phones that have GPS and WiFi. 5800 comes to mind as being very similar and having WiFi. For me it is non-issue. I specifically purchased the phone unlocked because I don't need internet on the phone and I don't want to pay for data plan or have a WiFi capability. GPS was my ""killer app"". Speaking of apps, Nokia has an extensive library. Not a gazillion of apps like Apple does, but certainly enough for myself. I pulled a few such as games and other stationary apps (not requiring internet). The OVI application works flawlessly. I wish it worked in Linux, but it doesn't. You have to have a Windows machine (I am not sure of Mac).The interface is great. People claim it isn't as good as iPhone, but it doesn't have to be. That's what N8 is for. The interface is as good as you want it to be for $150. The touchscreen is very responsive. The camera is OK. We use it knowing the pictures won't make it to a magazine cover.

B003DZERC6,1285372800,"Pro:Please refer to [..]for a complete review of Pros of the phone.Con:1. The sensitivity of the touch screen is not adequate. Sometimes, you need to put much force on it. Moreover the scrolling is not easy. It is common while scrolling, you double click on something by mistake.2. The phone is greed to use up the battery's energy. For instance, if you only use music player for about 4 hours, then the phone's battery will decharged within the next 24 hours during which the phone is actually in stand by and everything is off. Besides, the actual standby time of the battery is not 432 hrs as it is advertised, but about 200 hrs, not more. Considering this issues, what's the use of all the functionalities of the phone when you should turn them all off to save battery energy.3. The alarm is a devil. You cannot set the alarm's volume to the level you desire. I contacted Nokia customer service concerning this issue and they suggested that I use a tone with a low voice. Although, this answer does not solve the problem in general, I examined that and noticed a bug of the phone's firmware. I reduced the amplitude of my favorite tone to 10%. When I set the alarm tone to this one, I understand that this is not a simple problem. Because, the phone, when starts to alarm, the volume increases from that 10% to as much as the phone can make noise. The next time I checked with 2% tone. No use. Really silly, because the increasing state of tone has no upper threshold.4. The design for SIM card and RAM places are kinda trouble. In the package there is nothing help you to bring out the SIM card. And RAM won't come out easily.5. No wifi6. The one I bought, has a Chinese RAM. While transferring data to the RAM, it sometimes goes crazy and prevent data transferring. It doesn't matter how you this. I tried that via both the phone's usb connection and a seperate RAM-reader usb connection. Well, I cannot expect more from Chinese products.Overall, if you seek some mobile phone with such functionalities offered by this phone, don't waste your money on this.

B003DZERC6,1278028800,"Nokia had many GREAT phones in the past but this one is just POOR.  I had many Nokia phones before and they all had great usability.  The Nokia 5230 Nuron, however, makes me very disappointed.  I *rarely* refer to user's manual for electronic gadgets but this one got me.  I work as a User Interface Designer and I consider myself pretty techie.  I struggled a lot when I use the phone.  Thought maybe it was my problem.  No.  Gave it to another coworker to test it and he also got stuck on entering the most basic: Contacts.1. I spent 30 minutes trying to figure out how to use QWERTY to enter my contacts.  I had the Alphanumeric keypad up and I tried to find how to turn the QWERTY on.  Click on the icon that looks like a keyboard.  And they trick you!  A dropdown comes up and it only has 'Handwriting' and 'Alphanumeric keypad' on it.  No QWERTY.  I tried turning the phone horizontally.  Nothing changed.  Little did I know I had to turn the phone ""anti-clockwise"" to trigger the QWERTY keyboard to come up.  If you turn it the other way it won't work.  Fine!  Now I learned.  But that keyboard icon just totally got me.  If a keyboard can't be turned on from there, then don't make the icon looks like a keyboard for goodness sake!2. The MAP interaction is unintuitive.  I have the phone for 2 days already and I'm still trying to figure out how to use it properly.  First of all, who would use a SmartPhone MAP for the sake of looking at it these days?  Its main purpose should be for user to ""get directions"" to a place!  Not for the Nuron.  I open the MAP and I don't know what to do.  I see an ""Options"" button.  I click on it and was hoping to see a ""Go to place"" link.  No.  Instead I see a bunch of useless links.  The MOST important link isn't there.  Then there's a ""Search"" button.  EVERYTIME I click on it, I keep forgetting that I have to ERASE everything I typed in before in order to enter new entry.

First off; it's slow, slow, slow. The touchscreen not receptive at times, pressing the button over and over again to get it to respond and when it finally does you wind up pressing another then spend forever trying to close that one out. The call volume is terrible. I would put it on speaker then turn it down just to hear. The lock only works sometimes. I had to make it a habit of checking my phone often to make sure something wasn't running.This phone is supposed to be a smart phone wannabe and I can stress the wannabe strongly enough. It's not even close to being smart. There are a few apps. I recommend swype; there is a bit of a learning curve but it great after figuring it out. Another is pocket lock.I honestly think that anyone considering this phone should consider looking at another especially for the price or any price for that matter even free.

I had worn it on my belt while driving and my seat belt buckle put enough pressure on the mini-display to crack it. VERY disappointing. All Nokia had to do was put a thicker, more rigid plastic cover over the display and it would be fine. Instead, I have a busted phone. Except for the broken mini-display and the inability to see the clock or caller ID, the phone still works, but that mini-display is a Bad Design.A lot of people complain about the battery. At first I experienced very short battery times as well. I even bought a second battery for $15 with some other accessories. I have never needed it. I believe the battery gets better with time. At first it was displaying low battery charge. Now it goes for a couple of days no problem. I charge it each night, though, just to be safe.I bought the 6555 because it works with the Acura Hands Free Link system via Bluetooth. (Not all Bluetooth phones do.) It also works with the Ford Sync system. Both work very well. It is indeed nice to place or receive calls without having to find the phone. No clumsy earphones. No looking away to dial or press buttons. No wires at all. My wife leaves hers in her purse, I leave my in my pocket (not wearing it on my belt anymore--I might break it again.) With Sync, the Bluetooth even allows the phone to become a media player. Very cool.Using the free downloadable Nokia software, you can edit the phonebook from your laptop via the special--and hard to find--micro USB cable that costs $15. But if your laptop has Bluetooth like mine--because I bought a Microsoft Bluetooth wireless laser mouse 8000 and its Bluetooth receiver also receives other Bluetooth devices like my phone--you can connect without having to buy the micro USB cable. The cable is handy to carry though, so you can connect the phone to other computers if necessary to download pictures and video if needed. Using this software, you can also make your own ring tones. My custom ringtone is Hillary Clinton cackling/laughing.The main display has a nice large font that is visible in broad daylight. Color combinations (themes) are adjustable and some are better than others, but it's nice to have options.The phone has a speaker phone built in if desired.It's easy to switch from ring to vibrate--just hold the # key for a few seconds.If you have MS Outlook as your emailer, you can sync your calendar.The 6555 comes with a host of useful tools including: a Stopwatch with split times; a Countdown Timer to remember to take the roast out on time; a full-function Calculator; an Alarm Clock; Notes; To-Do list; and a Calendar.It has some dumb games that are mostly demo only.It has a very mediocre still camera and an even more mediocre video camera.It can text, but I don't do that.It can be configured for Push-To-Talk, at extra cost, if you must have walkie talkie capability.I was worried about the tiny charging plug, but so far it's been durable, even though it did obsolete all my previous Nokia accessories.It does need a micro-mini plug for the headphones if you want to use it as a personal music player. Mine included a short Micro-to-Standard mini adapter so you can use your regular headphones.The Settings menu allows you to reconfigure what many of the buttons will do: if you need to get to some buried menu item like the calculator often, make the Right Selector button do it. One touch and you're in business. This is a very handy feature.Overall, I am quite pleased with the phone. The audio quality is fine, it rarely drops calls and is small, thin and lightweight.

However, when I got to the store, I let the salesman talk me into this phone, which he said was a better quality, though at a higher price.  I took it home and immediately had problems. The vibration function did not work, no matter how much I adjusted settings, and the manual was no help.  I went online and saw that almost every review for this phone was negative.  Just this afternoon, the vibration miraculously started working, though intermittently, which confirmed to me that I had a defective phone.  I also was having problems with it powering down by itself, or suddenly lighting up--which was very annoying because I use my phone as an alarm clock so all of a sudden I would be awaken by a bright light in my room.  Perhaps mine was a lemon, however based on the other reviews I read, lemons with this model seem to happen fairly often.I also found that the way the operating system on the phone was set up was not very intuitive.  Maybe I just didn't spend enough time getting used to it (though I did spend about 4 hours on it last night trying to figure it out).  I consider myself fairly tech savvy, but I just don't understand why they make simple tasks like setting an alarm for am or pm require an additional 3 button pushes.  I also didn't need any of the ""sophisticated"" features, I only needed a phone that worked well as a phone, and that could text with relative simplicity.  The sound quality and signal strength were fairly good, but that was dwarfed by the other problems I was having.

B003U8EN7A,1365897600,"I have to start by saying that I actually like the Symbian operating system.  It lets you look under the hood and you're not locked into the Apple/Google world.  But you will decide on your own whether that's an issue or not.  I'm writing about this phone as a someone who hoped to replace my Nokia N8.The camera IS fantastic.  The world will discover this when Nokia puts it in their Lumias later this year.  It does make the phone fatter but the payoff is an unbelievably good camera.  Too bad it's contained within this phone.  Compared with the N8 it feels cheap/plastic-ally.  I could live with that if the memory card holder would actually click into place and hold the memory.  It didn't in mine and was held in by the battery pressing down on it.  That meant that the F drive would cut in and out and make it functionally useless.  Apps would appear then disappear.The manual (and the same looking e-mail client on the N8) promises multiple e-mail accounts.  Not on mine.  It only would allow one account, Exchange ActiveSync, and that didn't work.  I thought maybe it was something I was doing so I blew out my account on my N8 and entered the same info there.  It worked right away.  So the e-mail program was worthless.  I couldn't add any other e-mail accounts.  This is contrary to what the manual says is possible but I'm giving you my experience.  If it works for other people, great.  Me... I'm returning it and buying another N8.

B003U8EN7A,1354406400,"Synopsis:I received the Nokia 808 one week ago (from ""Tablet Distributors"" an Amazon partner VERY quickly), the week before Thanksgiving. My previous phone was the Nokia N8 which I love. But I'm a sucker for an amazing camera in a phone, thus the new phone.The 808 gives an amazing leap forward with its camera experience, offers some well deserved and performance improvements across the whole phone's operation, and a number of design improvements. Some of the standard and well loved performance features of Symbian are here too, features other phone os users have to pay for. The keyboard, a function which Belle (the Nokia OS at the time) surpasses all other smart device OS keyboards, has had a massive redesign, a move which will irritate and alienate many Symbian defenders, but with a week's use (or maybe two), they will be comfortable with.General speed improvements can be felt throughout all activities with this phone compared with the N8 or E7. No lagging, email hangups, or apps which are not sure if they want to open. Everything is waaay snappier than other smart devices I've had, including the tragic mistake of the Transformer Infinity which I returned.Just so you know, my base of comparisons for smartphones & devices: I have owned several Nokia smartphones (n95 (amazing camera & my first smartphone), E7, N8) and owned Android and iOS devices. I am familiar with all of these. And utterly love my N8. So nice.Camera:Skipping the obvious and amazing 41 mp camera and Pureview tech, the camera offers improvements and corrects annoyances from Nokia's other premium camera phones. It's way faster than other Nokia camera apps, opens faster than my other Nokia phone apps, takes pics faster once started, faster on the next pic. Camera app opens instantly. I mean it. There is ZERO lag. When you want to snap that perfect sneaky picture, the camera is ON and the pic is TAKEN end of story. No waiting. This is a big improvement over the N8, which, though its camera is probably STILL the 2nd best camera in a phone on the market, took awhile both to open the camera app and then had to cogitate over taking the picture. There are more camera options, all of which are more streamlined imho. Changing the options is super fast too. And the pic minimization routine at the end of the pic is quick too. Overall it's super fast and super good.There really is little need to expound on the camera. It is as good as, or likely far better than, most point and shoots and even hangs with DLSR's. Though it is slightly bigger than the N8, it is still not big enough for all the unicorns which obviously power the camera, so, they must be at the end of Bifrost in the galactic black hole. Or something. It's a pretty amazing camera.Key features:Like I said, I tend to go with a great camera phone, regardless the manufacturer. It just so happens the manufacturer is often Nokia. That's nice because I think Nokia phones are in general very well put together, feel solid in the way that closing the door of a high end car sounds solid compared to a very cheap one. Nokia phones feel like quality and the 808 is no exception here.The Map apps included in the phone or downloaded for free from the Store make the 808 equivalent or better than any separately purchased GPS device. Nokia Map related apps are amazing, free for life, and work offline, or via a range of GPS updating methods (3-3.5g, SMS, unassisted). Voice guided directions (walking or driving) everywhere on Earth? Got it. Public transit? Got that too. The GPS can work standalone with zero cell signal just like a separately purchased GPS device, or can work across the network signal (a-GPS), bluetooth, or even via SMS (text message). I like this because it lets me control data usage. A couple of Map apps you might want to try: World Gaze (interesting) and City Lens (love it, somewhat of an unsung hero imho).The 808 also conforms to the typical Nokia design philosophy which gives me control of my device and what is on it, and loads it with tons of codecs. A decent file browser is there. I can see where apps are installed, change the location to a memory card if I like, and the apps go with me to a new Nokia device. I've done it a million times. I love it. Nokia makes transferring everything from an old phone to a new one easy, and gives you several options on how to do it: backup/restore feature, transfer to removable memory, across Nokia servers, or turn on bluetooth and everything transfers locally. Nokia phones also let you toggle all the antennas, and with apps like Situations, you can automate and fine tune it. Also, more functions are supported in bluetooth in Nokia Symbian devices than other smartphones (even compared with Nokia Windows devices). Android devices almost come close to this level of device control, but, just, not quite. I like to control my own device.Other good stuff:The screen is super vivid. It does not have the pixel density of the iPhone or many Android phones out there, but it looks very rich.The music player is somewhat improved over the previous version of Belle. On my N8 running Belle, there were many podcasts which I would side load which would not play from the music player. Instead I would have to go to the file manager, find the file, and play it there. Now, Belle Feature Pack 2 Music Player catalogs and plays all of those podcasts too. I use Music Player more than any other app on my phone, so this is a major plus for me.Web appears to be much snappier, and also bears noticeable changes. Snappier first: rendering pages is WAY faster compared to Web on my N8 running Belle. Images load faster and the whole web page does too. It seems to support more video on the web. Changes second: Though the updated Web app is faster and handles web elements better, the Belle FP2 Web MENU is a large text scrolling menu. I prefer the previous menu in preFP2 which was a little popup screen containing a grid of icons. For me, the grid was nicer because all options were on screen and stationary, and it was more intuitive. Actually, I wish menus in all apps had grid menus; they are quicker to navigate I think.Gallery now adds a separator labelled with the date. This is a tiny change but I like it.The new Weather app is horrible because it never works, BUT BUT BUT the Weather-Widget, when installed on a home screen, is great. Soooo much faster, prettier, and more informational, than previous versions. Well who cares though since the old Weather app on preFP2 was slow and difficult. The new widget is fast, pretty, and just there on your screen. Maybe you're not supposed to use the app itself, just the widget. I'm happy because the widget makes more sense anyway.Audio out from the handset is so much better than the n8, E7, and n95. Moving from the N95, which had great stereo sound, to the E7 and N8, which had good sound but not great, and not stereo (I do not think) to the 808 which has very clear, rich, and loud speakers (um, Dolby I think) I was shocked at the fulness and richness of the sound from the phone's speakers, especially since it is not an N series device. Very nice upgrade.And, to follow up, audio IN is also much better. I really had a difficult time using the speaker phone with the N8 or E7 because the person on the other end could not hear clearly and kept saying, ""Are you using speaker phone?!?! Can you change to non-speaker?!"" But now, no one even notices when I switch to speaker. Thank you Nokia for returning standard phone features. Win. Carrying over to video capture, the audio in captured videos is improved compared to my N8, it is much richer.Removable battery cover, yay, and a more protected sim and sd memory card under it. I prefer the sim and sd cards here, not on the side of the phone.Nokia phones have often included the option of holding down the lock screen key to actuate the flash as a flashlight. The N8 did not have this option to the irritation of N8 fans. Thankfully the 808 brings it back. And the flashlight is very! bright.Also a little feature which I just found out today. If the phone rings or alarm goes off, you can turn the phone over and it silences. Like.Other good stuff:Usb on the go - mounts just about anythingHDMI out (this one is a different port than the N8 or the E7)massive codec support for audio and videofm radio receiverfm out - freakin love thisnfc though haven't  used it yetBigScreen app - plays photos and video to your TVDLNA Play app - broadcast video wirelessly to a DLNA enabled TV (free app if it is not on your phone)Sports Tracker (free Nokia app) - really amazing running/cardio/GPS appNot quite an N or E Series Nokia device though:As an N8 owner, I love its sleek sexy styling, clean lines, and nice design elements. The N8 is much sexier and much more stylish. The 808 is fairly stylish though. Both are well designed and constructed. But design-wise, the 808 misses many of the more debonaire stylings of the N8 such as a metal body (sadly), sleek metal retro volume rocker (the best volume rocker in the world, ever) and lock screen rocker of the E7 (the 808's lock screen locker is plastic I think, but at least it is a rocker, which is better than a button or switch), and sadly the eyecatching, 'breathing' single-solitary physical (and metal) button (of the N8). Actually, this feature (the breathing button on the N8) got lots of comments and questions from friends and acquaintances. I miss it, and the hypnotic notification lights (around the N8's button). These missing design features would have added an iconic styling to Nokia's last Symbian phone, the best camera phone ever, and the Symbian swan song. Oh well, an N808 the phone is not, so, que sera sera.Annoyances:The new keyboard is different, requires some mental adjustments, and is irritating to learn at first. Though it DOES offer some new features and improvements, the fact remains that the old, highly lauded Belle keyboard is not here. The keyboard seems to copy the look and feel of iOS and some Android keyboards. My typing (using two thumbs in landscape) is MUCH slower in Belle FP2 than the previous Belle keyboard which I have praised heavily in other reviews (which had excellent predictive text and autocomplete, but typing in upright phone with two thumbs is easier than in preFP2). The rearrangement of the caps key is inconvenient, and I have to constantly correct what i typed. Autocorrect and predictive text, long standing Symbian mainstays, are gone. It constantly requires the user to decide and choose, decide and choose, ugh; this will cause frustration at first, but after a week or two typing in this way should be come quicker. The previous Belle keyboard was much smarter though, type predict forget-about-it-because-its-correct type-new-word. It does have a few new improvements though, including correcting previously typed words; I like this feature! I think the new keyboard is larger than the preFP2 keyboard and in some apps it seems to hog the screen. Other reviewers here and elsewhere have slammed Nokia for the new keyboard. I will not ""slam"" Nokia for their keyboard choice, but, it would be nice if they gave an option of which keyboard to use, since it seems old keyboard is still there (a few apps or occasions call it up instead of the new one).The Notes application no longer autosaves. You MUST save your work before exiting. Word to the wise, folks, word to the wise. Also the keyboard is so large that only two rows of text can be seen (I know I already mentioned this but, well, it is important in the Notes app). Obvious design oversight. The menu/options seem to be scaled back.Photo and video editors which were on the N8 (ugh I loved these) are not available in Belle FP2 for the 808. But there are a good deal of camera apps. Some of these edit functions appear to be folded into the camera or other apps. I have not extensively investigated this though.Browsing the web without permanent navigation keys (left and right keys on the soft keyboard) is annoying, both in Nokia Web and Opera Mini (though Opera is a little easier to deal with).Gifs no longer play in the picture viewer. A much much missed feature :( Please bring it back :(Though it comes with Quick Office the product is installed but not prelicensed. Trying to license QO via QO itself does nothing. A trip to the Store - Oh well. Google purchased QO in 2012. And....... apparently axed their Symbian support.[Replacements for QuickOffice:Microsoft OneNote is a capable, a little prettier, and also has a few interesting features. Input in OneNote uses the new keyboard but withoutthe new FP2 keyboard's word suggestions, and no autocorrect. It requires sync'ing with your MS account to get the files off the phone. Microsoft Office is quite good though (though I have not found a way to change where documents are saved, which is important because it oddly saves to the c: drive, which imho should be reserved strictly for the OS). There are other office apps too but I have not tried them. SmartOffice comes to mind.]Panorama, a free app on my N8, is not available yet for the 808, but hope it will be soon.Wifi calling is probably baked into the phone as it has been in most Nokia s60 devices for nearly a decade. I do not believe ATT offers this feature and Tmo only allows it on devices purchased from Tmo. There are plenty of VOIP apps though including Skype and others. Fring is a good option too since you can configure it via lots of SIP services or using its own.Extra notes:Nokia apps I use a lot:Mail (add widgets to one of my home screens, accepts push mail or you can configure itEnergy ProfilerMobile Data Tracker (as a widget on one of my homescreens, which l can configure to actually turn off my own data usage after a set time, super useful)Connectivity AnalyzerCity Lens/Live View (awesome app(s), but you have to hit the red hang up button right after you open the app or it won't work, a tip I found in Greg Corbin's review/comments)Big ScreenMaps (use the heck out of this, best mapping software hands down)Internet MusicMusic (the player, not the store, but you know, if you are anywhere besides the US NokiaMusic lets you download just about anything to your phone for free, arg)My required and highly used 3rd party apps:Situations (used to be a free Nokia app but was spun out and got major improvements - a MUST have -automates phone character (profile and other stuff) based on conditions the user sets (like time of day or location) - for real folks just fork the cash and get it)Opera MiniOpera Mobile (as of 2012 Dec 06 it installs and works, )Gravity (somehow this app is better than every other twitter client I've used on any platform, and it accesses a bunch more social networking sites (even a few social networks which I loathe though))FringCutePress (very slick)CuteTubeAppStopAfter 1 week of use:The keyboard has actually learned how I type to some degree (I guess). And I have learned how the keyboard works as well. So my error rate has dropped prodigiously, and my speed increased proportionally. Still, I think the old Belle keyboard was superior (to the keyboards in both FP2 and omgomgomg Anna). Nokia, please enable a choice toggle in Settings :) So by this point I have acclimated dramatically and it is not such a pain. [If Nokia could return the preFP2 keyboard size and layout (esp for the numeric keyboard which I liked way better, add back the predictive text and autocompletion of preFP2, but keep the word choice thing up at the top of the keyboard, and give a setting/configuration menu that lets the user configure a personal setting, that would be awesome :D ]I am constantly impressed by the snappiness of the phone. I never thought my N8 was slow or anything (except starting up the camera for some reason) but the 808 seems to do everything noticeably faster.Final thoughts:The 808 could serve as a GPS device or an amazing camera on its own and without phone service. Actually, I have recently dwelled on the FreedomPop free 3-4g plan, using the 808 as my phone (via Fring or some other SIP app). So, expensive phone, but phenomenal camera, phenomenal GPS, and full featured in every way (minus Netflix and Amazon) with a free phone service. Possibilities ......Eight months later ... just learned there is no tethering via Bluetooth.Just found out that Nokia has removed the Bluetooth tether module from Bluetooth stack. If you are on linux you can test this. Turn on both device's bluetooth, connect them, from linux terminal type 'hcitool scan' and take note of the address returned. Then enter 'sdptool browse [address]' and you can see there is no 'Dialup Networking' module.

Superb Optical Quality, lots of customizable options. If you are looking for the best camera in a cellphone in 2013, look no further.

Reduced noise levels, snappy response.The main problems I noticed with the camera are mainly the focusing during macro (you do get the ""tap to focus"" option, but the issue remains) and white clipping (even with exposure comp and ND filter, camera tends to clip highlights).Overall, I find worth it to go through the pain of using Symbian.

It is definitely an adult phone I have owned androids before and this time wanted something that would last and not be a flash in the panI have read lots of comments about the phone being large and bulky, when mine arrived I was very surprised that this was not the case, it is nicely proportioned and feels solid and looks and handles like a quality productI have no experience with symbian prior to this and have had zero issues with a transition, it is simple and intuitive to use and I don't really recognise it from some of the reviews on cnet and other review sites I looked at before I got mine and I am really glad that I did not let them influence me, I have probably added 7 other apps as it arrives already loaded with most adult and working apps you require and to be honest I don't need a gazillion pointless additions that will only be used once or twice anywayI have used the radio transmitter and this is a nice feature and again everything needed is already loaded, the Big Screen app is really good and very quick and simple to use it was up and running on my TV as soon as I plugged it in to the HDMI socketThe camera...it has all been said already it really is brilliant, my wife has a Sony Erricson Arc S with 8 MP camera which is highly rated but this thing simply blows it away, friends with i-phones are amazed with the quality and that is not exactly a bad camera, nothing to add really it is mega impressive and even a rubbish photographer like myself who is just learning with this camera looks like a ProfessionalThe video is also really impressive, I have a 40 inch Hidef Samsung and the playback through it is flawless, it looks like CD quality and again it is really simple and intuitive to use.

To the contrary, I am a proud owner of the best in the business.I will not ramble, repeating the amazing features offered by this handset but here are some highlights.CAMERA- The camera far exceeds my expectations, especially in low light. The lossless zoom is truely incredible and amazes everyone I show. I wouldnt even waste time comparing other camera phones.OS - Nokia Belle OS with FP2 is very smooth, customizable and easy to use. I  have no shortage of useful apps.SCREEN- While it is no retina display, the screen is not at all pixilized as some would suggest. It is bright and colourful and the clear black display gives great contrast.OFFLINE NAVIGATION- Works very well without relying on data. Nokia has this strong advantage.FM TRANSMITTER  & HDMI- Im glad Nokia brought these back. Too bad these not featured on Lumia devices. Very useful for transmitting music to my car stereo and hooking up to my LED tv.BUILT- Not as big and bulky as I though it would be but noticably heavier than most phones you'll encounter. You get used to that quickly. It has excellent built quality consistent with Nokia devices and feels good in the hand.Would I recommend this phone to anyone?

After one and half year still looks like new and it is about feeling when it is pleasure each time I'm using it.Symbian is dead now and applications are disappearing and so are smartphone capabilities of this phone. Now reduced to email, browsing and hardly IM. Though I'm still able to share pictures and media.As phone it is just the best, best sound, best microphone, fast responses, easy maintainig contact list etc. Still best for offline navigation, maps and so on.I'm using sleeping screen feature a lot, I like to see my time all the night on the phone. I could just imagine everything what could be done with this feature. All notifications possibility...After this time I simply have feeling I would be able to return fully to this phone, if it would be just supported and I would have enough applications.I had few phones after it like older Samsung, Samsung S4 mini, Sony Xperia ZL, basically flagships. But Nokia 808 is still my favourite.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------After latest Over The Air update from Nokia to FP2 version crashes stopped. So now I can use qualities of this phone without compromises.I can only say:1. This phone has outstanding build and material quality, if you grab it by hand you simply feel quality and hardness of material. It is every time pleasure to hold it in hand.2. Outstanding display. After while of usage you simply forget lower resolution, it is really not needed for watching movies or daily work. You will only see perfect contrast and colors. This thing is really usable on direct sunlight. What you can do with 1200+ pixels if you simply not see them outside...3. Real multitasking. I love way I can switch my applications anytime and always find them in state I let them. This is not working on Android, iOS or WP...4. Perfect sound, compare it to other phones and you will be surprised how good is sound in speaker, or how good other side is hearing you because of your quality microphone.5. Data under control. I found only with Symbian possible to connect to data network even in roaming. With this phone you can control every byte sent. No automatic updates, annoying adds.6. Fast and reliable Nokia Maps.7. Multimedia device, perfect pictures, perfect Full HD videos even with 3x zooom, perfect sound. Playing Full HD videos without problems8. Real HDMI output, you just connect phone to TV and can watch videos and pictures in Full HD. You can even use phone on TV screen in 640x360 mode.9. Better battery usage than other systems. You can get 1-4 days of standby without charging from this device.10. Pentaband, you can forget frequencies, bands, it will work for voice and fast data all around globe.11. Symbian is not closed system like iOS, WP, you can enjoy freedom with your data in your phone. Connect it as you wish, Bluetooth, WiFi, SD, NFC...This device is really high end feeling. Durable, showing quality everywhere. So now I'm changing my review to 5 stars............Hello, I bought this item 5 weeks ago. This phone is SW or HW defective and it is restarting and crashing very frequently, few times per day, when internet connection is lost WiFi or 3G/2G.It is almost not usable for daily work, IM, internet access.Nokia is playing dead bug though problem is serious, affecting many users.Here is link for official Nokia page discussion about this problem.[...]Do not buy this phone if you are not accepting risk of daily freezes, crashes, not usability of 3G..",5,"10 5, 2012",Nokia 808 crashing (not anymore),Cell Phones,"Nokia 808 PureView Unlocked GSM Phone with Nokia Belle OS, 41MP Camera &amp; Carl Zeiss Optics, GPS, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth - Black",480,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 106696},Nokia,Cell_Phones,0.255895,0.2303055,0.0255895

Are the writers brainwashed?I changed my iPhone 3G to Nokia 808 and I am happy I did! Originally I did it to get rid of carrying a separate camera (Panasonic LX5) - 808 is better camera and only the half of the weight.I need good phone and as a phone this is probably the best on the market. I was also surprised how good offline navigation it has.The screen resolution doesn't bother me as it shows all I need and very well. The screen is outstanding in the direct sunlight. When I compared the screen to iPhone4S with higher resolution, I couldn't understand the big debate about the resolution 360*480 seems to be good enough and more pixels do not make it better to use.How about Symbian? Once again where is the beef? Even with one core it seems to be fast and I can easily modify the start screens the way I want. Putting WAN, Bluetooth and others on/off is very nice just scrolling from the top of the screen. It is very easy and nice to use. Nokia supports Symbian till 2016 and I change my phone after 2-3 years anyhow.Applications? I need weather, stock info, memos, calendar, calculator, navigation and all of them work just fine for me. Sport Tracker is very useful for me, too. I don't use email in my phone but it has it. I am not heavy user of Twitter or Facebook but I could easily use my phone for those, too. I use MacBookPro when I want to use browser, email or view/modify photos. I use Opera browser of the phone occasionally and it could/should load pages faster.It is good I didn't listen to the warnings of the biased articles.

B003U8EN7A,1394582400,"The 808 is a weird device, and it is even weirder in 2014 now that Symbian is no longer officially supported.  Some observations:Pros:-It's really wonderfully made!  The build quality, heft, and the way it fits into your hands immediately makes you feel like you've got a quality device that will last you years.-The voice and speakerphone quality are excellent and far above what I've heard on any other phone including those from Apple, Motorola, and HTC.  Quality is roughly equal to the Nokia Windows phones.-The camera is obviously great.  However, there are some caveats.  You really need to play with the settings to get a good photo.  Dynamic range and exposure metering are sometimes problematic.  Noise starts to become apparent in photos at ISO 1600, and sometimes creeps into darker ISO 800 scenes.-Removable battery and SD card!  Again, this is a phone you can keep for a long time.-Battery life is insane.  I keep data off because the ""smart"" functions of this phone aren't worthwhile (see below), and the phone easily lasts a week on a charge.  With data on, expect 2-3 days of use before recharging, although YMMV depending on your habits obviously.Cons: (pay attention!)-Yes, Symbian is dead.  The Delight team keeps it going with excellent custom firmware releases, but at this point you should buy this phone expecting it to act as a great feature phone with some ""smart"" functions like mapping and basic email.  Beyond those basic capabilities, Symbian is pretty worthless.  It's web browser is terrible, and even the push email via Exchange ActiveSync is unreliable.  Often, my phone refused to receive push email despite Nokia's solid integration with Microsoft.-The Amazon seller BREED shipped very fast and the price was fair.  The phone looked new, but was not wrapped and there were some scratches on the battery.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, this seller stocks phones from a Portugese carrier called TNM.  This carrier never released Feature Pack 2 for Symbian Belle.  Feature Pack 1 is as far as you can upgrade, and there are major issues with this.  The virtual keyboard in FP1 is truly awful to the point of being almost unusable, while FP2 provided a much improved keyboard.  Therefore, you really need to be comfortable flashing the firmware to get the latest Symbian release.-The 808 has a very annoying hardware issue where using 3.5G (HSDPA) under low signal conditions results in a hard reset.  The only solution is to disable HSDPA and use 3G, which is much slower.  The poor internet capability of Symbian means this is not a huge drawback for me - you won't be streaming Netflix, etc. and 3G is sufficient for checking the weather, stocks, and email.  Spotify does exist for Symbian, however, and being restricted to 3G could be problematic for those users.In conclusion:The 808 is a niche product.  Some reviewers will try to convince you the camera is the bee's knees, the best thing since sliced bread.  It is a very good camera, but the Lumia 1020 and iPhone 5S are both competitive.  Therefore, buying this phone is a huge compromise that is best undertaken if you fully understand its pros and cons.  Having a geeky interest in Nokia helps.  For me, the combination of beautiful and interesting hardware with fantastic camera and battery life was worth the tradeoff compared to a more common, modern phone.  I love to travel and take day trips on my bike, and don't use any major apps.  The 808 fits right into my lifestyle.",4,"03 12, 2014","Beautiful phone, beautiful photos, but be aware what you are getting into!",Cell Phones,"Nokia 808 PureView Unlocked GSM Phone with Nokia Belle OS, 41MP Camera &amp; Carl Zeiss Optics, GPS, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth - Black",480,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 106696},Nokia,Cell_Phones,0.0992124,0.0661416,0.0330708

B003DD00JC,1309478400,"I wrote a review for this phone on AT&T;'s site, but for some reason it was rejected.  Perhaps AT&T; doesn't want customers to know another of their phones has severe problems.  I can't rewrite it word for word, but I can come close, only this time I will be harsh about AT&T.;I've had this phone since October 2010.  I had a Palm Centro before, and while the Pre is very different, I liked it.  Then just a few months ago the bad started.First, dropped calls.  I've had many dropped calls and randomly get ""connecting..."" when attempting to make a call.  Sometimes it connects, sometimes it doesn't.  I thought it was because I moved to a new area, but since everyone else in my family has AT&T; as well and no trouble where I live, it's not the service, it's the phone.  Even more proof it is the phone is the fact that if I restart the phone I can connect fine... for awhile.  It's not that I don't have service - my bars will be almost full and I still will have trouble.  Once the phone even went into SOS mode for no reason.  A restart fixed that right away.  Restarting once in awhile is fine, but to have to do it so many times is ridiculous, especially since it takes so long to start up.Second, texting trouble.  Whether or not my texts are sent I don't know.  I know one of my friends doesn't always get them, but she had the same trouble when I had my Centro, so I think it's her Blackberry.  My main trouble is typing, though I have had errors when attempting to send a picture I took on my phone.  Again, a restart fixed the picture sending problem.  When my calls started to have trouble it wasn't long after that my keyboard started to not work correctly.  I either get no response or multiple letters when pressing some buttons.  My backspace button is probably the worst (likely because of how many times I have to use it to correct the typing errors), followed closely by ""e"".  Search the internet - this is a common problem.  I even tried a full erase hoping that would solve the problem (it is unknown if this is a hardware or software problem), but of course it did not help at all with the keyboard, which I figured but thought I'd try in the rare chance it would.The phone is a nice size, depending on the size of your hands, and the keyboard is nice (when it works).  It could have been a great phone if they would have worked out all the problems.  I guess someday I will have to go into my local AT&T; store (assuming there is one in this area) and complain.  In the past all I've got from them was a ""yeah, that phone has those problems"" and nothing else, so unless things have changed I guess I will have to find the charger for my Centro.  I still have a year until upgrade time, and I guarantee I will never again get a Palm as long as they are owned by HP.  I can't say I'm happy with AT&T; either, but I never was - I WAS happy with Cingular.  The only thing keeping me with AT&T; is the family plan I am part of because it saves us all some money.  Bottom line: don't get this phone unless you don't intend to use it often.",2,"07 1, 2011",Nice phone plagued with problems,Cell Phones,Palm Pre Plus Mobile Phone (Verizon),70.57,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 49841},Palm,Cell_Phones,-0.323326,0,-0.323326
B003DD00JC,1296345600,"I had been a loyal Palm customer for quite a few years, upgrading regularly, purchasing Palm devices for other family members, and very appreciative of the features for which Palm had at one time been the market leader.  So when my mobile phone needed replacement about a year ago it didn't take much convincing for me to get a Palm Pre Plus.  Between business and social life I had accumulated over a thousand contacts in my Palm address book, and I had come to depend on the excellent support I got from the Palm in organizing, searching, and retrieving that information.  Nearly as important was the exceptional calendar software on the Palm for keeping tracking of all my meetings and appointments.  I was attracted by the prospect of continuing with the company which had provided all of these superb tools, now to be combined with my mobile phone so that I could now carry around one device instead of two.  It never occurred to me that Palm would throw away all of the development in which it had invested over the years and replace it with a significantly inferior platform.  I won't go into all of the details of features Palm dropped on the floor (contact categories, desktop sync, full text searching, structured storage of postal addresses, etc.): other reviewers here have already cataloged those.  Eventually I resigned myself to the feature downgrade and tried to make the best of the situation by taking advantage of other new capabilities which the previous Palm devices hadn't had, in particular the ability to schedule jobs, which I used to have the Pre send a nightly copy of my contact information to my desktop workstation.  However, even these new features were broken, as I found out when the device silently turned off all of the scheduled tasks any time it was powered down, which happened more and more frequently as the battery became increasingly unreliable.  The really serious problems kicked in as I approached the end of the first year with the device.  The calendar started losing or garbling event information: I'd enter a weekly meeting and it would just disappear as soon as I saved it.  For other appointments the Palm Pre would silently change the date: I would schedule something for the following Tuesday and the Pre would save it for Wednesday instead.  The device also started shutting itself down unpredictably: one minute the battery would report that it had a 40 percent charge remaining, and 60 seconds later it changed its mind and said there was 0 percent power left and was turning itself off.  Reporting all of these problems was a waste of time: Palm no longer seems to care about customer support or tracking down and fixing bugs.  So after a year of struggling to live with all the defects I finally gave up last week and replaced the device.  I have just turned off the last Palm I'll ever own.",1,"01 30, 2011",Very disappointed (former) Palm customer,Cell Phones,Palm Pre Plus Mobile Phone (Verizon),70.57,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 49841},Palm,Cell_Phones,-0.213212,0,0

My carrier is Verizon and the Palm Pre was one of the phones I could get for free with a renewal of my 2 year contract.  The advantage of owning this particular phone is that it is a smart phone and has all the perks of a smart phone.  However, here are some of the disadvantages:It takes the phone literally 3-5 minutes to start up when you restart or turn the phone on.  God forbid there was an emergency where you'd need to call 911 and your phone happened to be off.When viewing previous text messages if you scroll up too quickly it doesn't show some of the messages.The buttons are tiny.  I have small fingers but it took me awhile to get used to typing and even now, I have to use my fingernails to completely depress the buttons.Moving the face (screen) up too quickly can cause the phone to turn off by itself.This very morning a message popped up on my lovely Palm Pre phone stating I was no longer signed into my Palm profile and I would need to restart it. I did nothing out of the ordinary to cause this to happen. There was no option of simply getting rid of the message without restarting so I did.  It then acted like an unactivated phone.  I had to re-enter all my passwords, and lost all my saved text messages.  Luckily the contacts were automatically saved on my gmail account but now my contact list also includes 200 people from my facebook account that I have no desire to have in my phone's contact list.  When contacting Palm, they of course, could do nothing, not even tell me why it could have happend.  I've had this phone for about a year and a half and cannot wait to get rid of it.

B003DD00JC,1321315200,"I have owned a Palm Pre for over a year now. In January, I will upgrade to a different phone, quite happily. Bad reviews are fun to write, because you can be sarcastic and snide. I write this review with a heavy heart. I wanted to have a good experience with this phone. It replaced a Palm Treo, which in turn replaced my Palm Pilot.I should start with the good: The Pre was the very first phone to actually multitask, so that two or more applications could run at once. The screen is generally bright, if small (3.1 inches, compared with 3.4 inches for the iPhone and 4.3 inches for many Android devices). Once you get used to it, the keyboard is acceptable, if small and a bit cramped. The camera takes relatively decent photos for 3 megapixels.The mediocre: While it synchs nicely with my Gmail calendar, if I am entering an appointment time on the phone itself, I have to use an awkward ""wheel"" for any starting time other than the top of the hour. I have gotten used to it, but still find this feature annoying.Now the bad: I am actually on my second Palm Pre. The first one needed replacement when the only way I could accept calls was through the external speaker. The second, replacement phone, will only power on when I pull up the slider bar and expose the keyboard. The top ""on/off"" button works for putting the phone in ""vibrate mode,"" but nothing else.Additionally, the cover to the micro USB port on both phones was flimsy and broke off. Last week, the MP3 player decided it no longer wanted to play when I wanted to listen through headphones. Even before then, the volume control (on both phones) was abysmal.Battery life is terrible. My phone ran out of power, in airplane mode, while listening to music on a 3 hour flight. When doing web searches, the phone becomes hot -- much hotter than other devices I have used. The charging dock is a good concept for charging the phone, though I have discovered it is easier to charge simply by plugging it in.The Worst: WebOS, while innovative, has been abandoned by its current owner, Hewlett-Packard. As a result, the operating system itself is not being updated. Additionally, there is no incentive for developers to actually create apps for WebOS devices. Where both Apple and Android can claim to literally have hundreds of thousands of downloadable apps, WebOS has under 10,000. While nobody has an use for most of the Apple and Android Apps, certain ones, like Shazam or barcode scanners, are invaluable -- and not to be found in the WebOS catalog.So here's the bottom line: You can spend $50 to $100 for a Palm Pre Plus, and quite possibly have all the problems I have had with my two, or you can get something else. I suggest the ""something else.""",1,"11 15, 2011",Don't Buy This Phone,Cell Phones,Palm Pre Plus Mobile Phone (Verizon),70.57,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 49841},Palm,Cell_Phones,-0.354876,0,0

B003DD00JC,1294704000,"Pros:- Beautiful and comfortable design.- Great screen/display resolution.- Responsive touchscreen.- Multitasking: can use more than one application at the same time.- Physical (slider) qwerty keyboard.- Good call/sound quality.- Good music player; great sound with headphones.- Camera takes wonderful pictures.- Camera flash can also be used as a flashlight.- Can be charged without cables, with the touchstone charger.- The proximity sensor automatically disables the touch screen and turns off the display whenever I put the phone up to my ear and turns it back on when I take it away from my face.- Besides the calendar, it seems pretty fast.- 3.5mm headset jack, unlike the Palm Treo (2.5mm); but most phones now have 3.5mm.- Good web browser.Cons:- Terrible battery life. I can use it for a day with moderate use: I don't check emails on my phone and talk less than one hour a day; I use wifi for a few minutes a day. Higher capacity batteries are available, but they significantly bulk-up the phone and can't be used with the touchstone.- Most Palm App Catalog applications are only available in the USA. I live in Central America and cant' access the App Catalog; therefore, I can't download applications from it. I have to use Preware or Homebrew (unofficial freeware), which only display some free apps, most of which are being tested.- No application to sync with Outlook. I had to buy a $40.00 external application to be able to sync; and can only do it at my home network.- Most applications are web-based; so they can't be accessed unless there's wifi or with a data plan with available service.- Can't edit MS Office documents; can only view them. And - of course - can't sync any files.- Small, cramped keyboard. I don't have big hands, and have to type with my fingernails. Also, the edges are higher than the rest of the keyboard, so the keys next to the edges are difficult to press.- Calendar takes over a minute to display appointments over 6 months ahead/behind.- Bluetooth can only be used with audio devices; which means I can't send or receive files from other cell-phones or computers.- No zoom on the camera.- Instant messaging only for Google Talk and AOL; I use Yahoo Messenger.",3,"01 11, 2011",Disappointed in Palm,Cell Phones,Palm Pre Plus Mobile Phone (Verizon),70.57,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 49841},Palm,Cell_Phones,-0.455719,-0.2278595,-0.2278595

B003DD00JC,1295395200,"This review is written for people who have experience with previous Palm OS devices.  I previously had a Palm Pilot, a Song Clie (w/ Palm OS), and a Palm Centro.  I loved them all.  The OS was great and I have built up a large list of contact and personal information that I keep in my phone (safe and securly).  This was my main reason to continue using Palm OS.This is what you may expect to find in the Palm Pre that will be missing:You have to use the touch screen.  Have to.  There is no longer a cursor button.  FYI this makes editing a line of text, i.e. cusor movement to go back a few letters to make a correction, very challenging.Contact groups (categories) are gone, you cannot display contacts by group.  The concept of groups doesn't exist.You can't search all records.  You can search for a record name, but the full-text search that would also search the text of notes within records is gone.There is no private record.  You can password protect the phone.  However if you previously enjoyed being able to hide private records instead of entering a password every time you turned on your phone you will be disappointed as it is not possible anymore.Notes attached to a contact will be displayed as raw &lt;html> unless you edit the record.The battery life is HORRIBLE.  My Palm Centro would last 4-5 days before a re-charge.  My Palm Pre can barely make it through ONE day.  I have followed all of the Palm recommendations to reduce battery use.There are no birthday alarms.  If you have contacts with a birthday and expect it to notify you of the event in advance you will be disappointed, that feature doesn't exist on the Pre.Problems I've had with my Palm Pre:Sometimes the alarm clock doesn't work.  Yes - that's right, it is unreliable.  Do an internet search on that topic and you will see lots of other people who have experienced it too.Sometimes the phone doesn't ring or mostly - text messages don't make a sound when they are received.  This is not user error, the phone is not on silent and a message sound is enabled for txt messages.Sometimes the phone shutsdown.  There is no notification when your phone just shuts down.  You won't know until you go to use your phone and when you turn it on it goes through the boot sequence (which takes a few minutes - it's not fast).Frequently the phone intermittently hangs while in use, then suddenly all of the actions you have done (or were attempting to do) happen all at once.  You need to excercise patience when the phone doesn't respond right away.  It takes some getting used to.The antenna strength is poor compared to my Centro.What I like about it:The screen brightness and resolution is better then anything I've had before.Email and web browsing is acceptable.There are some clever and entertaining games that take advantage of the motion sensing technology.Customer support is good.",1,"01 19, 2011",Not like previous Palm OS devices,Cell Phones,Palm Pre Plus Mobile Phone (Verizon),70.57,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 49841},Palm,Cell_Phones,-0.235022,0,0

B003DD00JC,1388102400,"1) The battery only lasts about half of a day. This is not a problem with my battery, it is a problem with all Palm batteries. I keep idiotically buying new ones hoping for a different result, and it's always the same.2) The app store is frozen. I was bored one day and went onto it to download some new games, and the installs keep failing. Now every time I turn on my phone (see also: #7) there is an extra few minutes I have to wait for my phone to attempt to install those games, fail, and notify me of its failure so that I can get rid of said notification. Every time I try to go onto the app store to unpurchase those games (which is, rather stupidly, the ONLY way to get rid of them), the app store just freezes, so not only can I not download anymore apps now, but this process of waiting for my phone to fail six installs every time I turn it on is now a permanent feature.3) The alarm clock is broken. If I try to set more than two alarms, all of them will mysteriously be reset to go off at the same time as a random one in the group. &#34;So then,&#34; you might ask, &#34;why not just set two alarms a little extra early and keep snoozing them?&#34; Glad you asked! Half the time, if you hit the snooze button, the phone mistakes it for dismiss, then realizes its mistake 22 MINUTES LATER. A lot of good that does when you have a 9:30 meeting to attend.4) The 3G is so slow, I can only use it in situations in which I am willing to wait a full five minutes per loading screen.5) People often tell me during phone calls that I sound muffled or far away.6) The send button for texts and e-mails is delayed and often bugs out, sending the same text three times and then opening the pictures folder because it thought maybe I wanted to send a picture.7) Speaking of which, only sends/receives pictures successfully about half the time via text. Only succeeds about 10% of the time via internet.8) Takes FOREVER to turn on.Seriously. Don't give these people your money. You're not buying a smart phone.

B003DD00JC,1278374400,"I received my Palm Pre Plus from AT&T; about two weeks ago. I have owned a Palm Centro for a couple of years now, and I naively expected the same functionality from the Pre Plus that I enjoyed with my Centro. That really was my fault as I didn't do enough homework on the features and functions of this phone compared to the traditional Palm OS.Physically, the phone felt comfortable in my hands. It wasn't heavy enough to be burdensome, but it wasn't so light that it felt like a toy. The keys have the traditional clear overlay that protects the letters, and they are a bit larger and better spaced than on my Centro or Treo 650. I was very pleased with the slide out keyboard.Learning to navigate the phone via the swipe motions took about three or four days to become totally natural. It would have been much easier if Palm had included better instructions with the phone, but the included manual contained little more than instructions on how to turn it on, answer a call, etc.Setting up the necessary software to customize the phone was moderately challenging, even though I am one of two of my school's officially labeled ""geeks"". Web OS seemed to me to have been shipped prematurely. There are many wonderful customizations available, but you have to download several programs and rely on what's called ""Homebrew Apps"" or third-party software for the features that old-school Palm users take for granted. For example, there is no custom ringtone for unknown callers, no options for reminders, no easy scrolling through a text message to quickly fix an error in the line above, limited or no brightness options, etc.Traditional Palm software for the Centro and Treo phones will not work on WebOS. You can buy an app for the Pre that will allow you to run some (but not all) Palm OS apps on the Pre.There is no included phone-to-pc sync option. For me and many other Centro/Treo users, this was a BIG deal. There is an app that will allow you to back up your Pre to your desktop, BUT the the traditional hot sync is not available on WebOS. The phone comes with Google calender sync installed, but any attempt to sync Google Calender, the Pre, AND Outlook will result in possibly hundreds of duplicate event entries. There is third-party software you can purchase to allow a full sync with Outlook, but it can cost as much as $60-$70. Even those software options do not back up your media to your computer. You are on your own with that one.Another nasty surprise was the missed call notification. When the Pre informs you that you have missed a call, a tap on the screen will open up the dialog that lets you know whose call you missed. Unfortunately, it immediately dials the number of the missed call AT THE SAME TIME. It is really unpleasant to be in the middle of a meeting or other activity and find yourself trying to explain to your mother that you really didn't mean to call her back right then or why you felt compelled to call her and hang up.As they say in the world of Pre, though: There's a patch for that. In other words, you can download system tweaks that change many of the basic functions of the Pre and make it more user-friendly. While I think that's great, I also believe that most of it shouldn't be necessary.On the bright side, should you brick your phone playing around with Homebrew (unofficial freeware) apps or patches, Palm has available for download Web Doctor. This script will restore your phone to factory specs, erasing everything except what your Pre shipped factory with. When you sync with your Palm account, your address book, Palm store apps, and a few other things will be restored. Your media, however, is gone forever unless you have used USB mode to access your media folders and backed them up manually or used a cloning app to copy your Pre data for restore.There is no removable memory option. The Pre comes with 16g on-board drive space, and that's it. It offers the option to choose ""charge"" or ""Use in usb mode"" when you plug in the included USB charging cable.While the battery life is terrible, there has been a sharp drop in the price of charging accessories. The Touchstone (a cable-less charger) has dropped from the $70 range to around $20 shipping and all here on Amazon. There has likewise been a similar drop in the price of car chargers, AC to USB converters, and replacement batteries.An item of note: The batteries for the Pre are physically indistinguishable from Centro batteries with the exception of the black outer packaging that the Pre battery comes in. Palm says that you are not to use Centro batteries in the Pre, but they have not as yet made an official statement as to why. They only warn you that using a Centro battery in a Pre can damage your phone. They just won't tell you how. This is especially frustrating as not only are the two batteries both listed at 1150mAh, but there is a substantial price difference between the two - not to mention that many Pre users already have a ton of Centro batteries lying around gathering dust. If you ever get bored, you can always head over to one of the Pre message boards on the web and get the Pre/Centro battery argument going (again). You'll have more entertainment than you can stand, I promise.There are many features of the Pre that made the phone worth the (mostly initial) aggravation. The ability to minimize apps, leaving them open as you open another, is wonderful. As I don't have the best data access in my location, I can open the web browser and leave it minimized while I send a text or record an event into my calender. It comes GPS enabled, and while the AT&T; GPS servie is extra, Google maps is not.The browser is incredibly easy to use, and it offers several short-cut options that put your favorite sites within single tap availability. It also switches between apps quickly and easily without forcing you to start from the beginning in each one. It also still threads chat messages.You get thirty days of free phone support with your new phone, and after thirty days, phone support is about $15 an hour. Chat support is always free.The Pre Plus is is a great geek phone that with many options available for customization - including many free themes. It can get expensive buying the apps that many Centro users have felt should have been included with the phone, however, and setting up the customization will be beyond the comfort zone of may users. While the battery life is abysmal, chargers and replacement batteries are becoming more affordable. The graphics are stunningly clear and sharp, the screen is an optimal size in relation to the device, and the versatility of functioning as a thumb drive is an added plus.In summary, the crux of it is this: it has a mixed bag of positives and negatives, and the way you will feel about it will be directly related to the degree of tech-savvy that you have. If you are a Treo or Centro user who is upgrading, don't expect a great (or even pleasant) out-of-the-box experience, and you need to be prepared to shell out additional $$ for third-party software needed to complete the functionality of the phone. For me, that meant spending about $100 on additional software to allow me to sync, run some classic apps, and to replace a couple of old favorites that just wouldn't run on an emulator.",3,"07 6, 2010",Palm Pre Plus Review from Centro User,Cell Phones,Palm Pre Plus Mobile Phone (Verizon),70.57,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 49841},Palm,Cell_Phones,0.0302181,0,0.0302181

But honestly, I don't use my mobile device for launching missiles, I just want something I can use Facebook, check email, buy airline tickets, check headlines, watch the occasional video and make phone calls.  Nothing real fancy, so if you want to do these simple tasks, the Pre is the device for you.  The email inbox and messaging integration  is second to none, meaning all emails from hotmail, Gmail, etc, appear in the same inbox if you want, and all texts, even grom GTalk or AIM, appear in the same app too.

B003DD00JC,1310342400,"In early December 2010, my Motorola SLVR died and I needed a new phone.  I wanted a smart phone, namely an iphone BUT I would have had to cough up about $200 to upgrade to an iphone whereas I could get this Palm Pre Plus for free.  The only change in cost would be that I would have to get a data plan for at least $15/month.  At first, I loved it because going from a ""non-smart"" phone to a smart phone is great.  However, I began to notice that the signal strength was poor anytime I was in my home.  This resulted in calls being dropped CONSTANTLY.  Or at times, when people tried to call me, the phone wouldn't even ring, the call would go straight to voice mail and eventually I would discover I had the voicemail.I called Palm who wanted to blame the problem on AT&T;'s coverage.  I knew that wasn't the problem because we (husband & I) had both had cell phones with great signal strength previously through AT&T.;  The problem only existed with the Palm.  So I was on the phone for an hour and a half or so troubleshooting trying all kinds of things.  Nothing worked.  To be fair, the last thing the Palm customer service people suggested was ""resetting"" the phone so it went back to its factory settings.  I didn't want to try that and didn't have any reason to believe that would work when nothing else did so I didn't do the reset.Today was the last straw.  I was at the doctor's office waiting for an appointment when my husband called.  I answered the call, noticed I had 0 bars of reception, and the call dropped before I could get 5 words in.  I tried to call him back to no avail.  There was no reception for the 2 hours or so I was inside the doctor's office building.  When I got outside, I attempted to call my husband back and again, even though I'm OUTDOORS--no reception.  Made the call but before we could say much of anything, the call dropped.  I can not wait to get rid of this useless garbage!!!Also, the camera on the phone lacks a zoom feature.When I had only had it for a few months, it mysteriously ""died.""  It had a good charge and everything and when I picked it up, the screen was black & I couldn't get it to turn on.  I replaced the battery & it worked again.  This happened again recently & I found a way to bring it back to life on palm's support site.

I bought a $40 battery and I just started using it today but I noticed a difference right away as it seems the battery wears down even without much use.  The phone really does rival the iphone in many aspects.

I use mine daily too.- Great Camera!  Pics are crystal clear. The video quality isnt bad either.- The mobile hotspot works great so does the wi-fi.

The size of the Pre plus is perfect for me.- I dropped the phone in the river and it came back perfectly.Only Cons I can think of are:Verizons making me upgrade my data plan and I dont use alot of internet on my phone so Ive decided to sell it.Battery life needs to better for heavy use.",4,"08 9, 2011",Great phone for the price!,Cell Phones,Palm Pre Plus Mobile Phone (Verizon),70.57,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 49841},Palm,Cell_Phones,0.157189,0.157189,0

I'm honestly glad I waited this long as my love for the phone has diminished considerably since I got it back in December of 09.Pros first:-The phone gets great reception, although that probably has more to do with my carrier than the phone itself;-Fits comfortably in my hand and pocket;Not-so-good stuff:-Extremely short battery life. Even with very limited use I found myself having to charge it after only about 12 hours. My battery has only seemed to have gotten worse over time. There are days when the battery drops to below 10% after only about 6 hours of very limited use;-The finish of the phone is extremely slick. I'm not a clumsy person, but I've dropped this phone dozens of times since I've had it because the surface is so slippery;-The keys & the keyboard are extremely small. Even my wife who has very petite hands also has some difficulty using the keyboard effectively;-The swipe navigation took some time getting used to and continually ""misreads"" my swipes. It's frustrating making the same swipe motion several times before the phone recognizes what you're actually wanting to do;-Multitasking isn't what it's cracked up to be with the Pre. Several other reviewers have mentioned how great the phone is for multitasking. I've found that while switching between apps is quite easy and fast, the phone sort of chokes when you receive a call while using an app. I've missed many calls due to this;-The screen scratches very easily. I've been very gentle with my phone, but somehow it has many scratches on it;-The camera does not perform well at all. Granted, I didn't buy the phone for the camera, but there have been times when I wished the camera performed a bit better. Also, because the cover of the lens is recessed in the back of the phone it is very difficult to clean off the lens without completely removing the back cover;-The app market for Palm users isn't nearly as robust for Droid or iPhone users.

My ATT upgrade comes up next month and I've been convinced by my son's flawless performance with his iPhone which phone I will choose next.What problems specifically?  I use my ATT Wireless account as my business phone.  I have suffered dropped calls in locations where my son (iPhone 3G) and wife (Motorola V9X) have no problems whatsoever.  That's the big one.  I'll take you through it:  4 bars, make call, begin conversation, silence, the terrible ""dropped call bell"", look at meter, no bars, then 3-4 bars all of a sudden.Then there's the flaky performance of the touchscreen - delays, non-responsiveness, accidental callings/hangups.  Maddening.  The battery cover has been removed so many times that I started to keep a fingernail specially-shaped to press the release.Transferring the contacts.  Wow... Palm didn't want to make that very easy but I found a way to export contacts and transfer them to Google (gmail) which can then be sync'd to the iPhone.For the ATT network, open the phone dialer and type #*66623# (other networks ##66623#) then push the call button.  Push the Cellibrite Export button, connect the Pre to your computer using USB and once connected press the USB Drive button on your phone.  Using windows' Folder Options, ""unhide"" hidden files.

I replaced it twice (this is my 2nd replacement), but only this phone had any misfunctions (after being left out in the rain for a whole weekend! I'm lucky only a bonkers ringer/ external speaker was the only problem!). Anyway all my phones did all I told them to with little to no fuss, I HIGHLY suggest this phone to anybody who does not have a stable income like mine (is NOT stable), don't think you HAVE to deal with a hefty smartphone fee! Anyway here are my pros and cons (well only cons since I'm sure you know all the pro's)-well first off the battery life IS PHENOMINAL it'll last about a day under heavy use, more than half a week IF YOU CHARGE IT RIGHT! Luckily I always turn my phone off before charging and that is what I suggest you do. The charging meter is unreliable, the final bar is like 10x as large as the rest so it seems like you NEVER charge your phone enough if you don't turn it off first. You CAN charge it when it's on, but it won't last more than a few hours under normal use.the screen when talking on the phone is VERY un user friendly... I'm not experienced with other touchscreen phones but DANG this thing is aggravating! Everything else is fine I just can't stand looking at my phone and UNLOCKING IT every time I have to do something while in a conversation. I just wish there was a button for that.I don't use the GPS so I can't comment but there IS one... I think. If ATT still supports it. Many of the software functions of this phone is starting to become unsupported and that sucks... Not that I use any of them anyway butYes the screen is a dinky 4.5&#34; but everything from youtube to a variety of message board forums work just fine! I don't play any facebook games but... well the processor is ancient so I'm not expecting much.There are no 'apps' sorry it's NOT a smartphone, just the basics. OK there may be some basic programs you can d/l but probably nothing special. Just sayin' it's a phone not a game console (though it CAN youtube- I didn't try hulu, netflix and the like... I doubt they'd work BUT good ole' youtube!). I don't play music on it but the 3.5&#34; headphone plug is right there xD.The internal (phone) speaker has never been SUPER easy to hear. It's not bad just... I would not give it an awardDon't bother if your paranoid, there is NO security on this phone, the locking feature is only there to annoy you not to keep bad guys out :x.sliding the KB out is rather tough some times, it can snag on a stubborn gear, a grain of sand or a rock if your phone is dirty. I usually keep my phone in a clean environment, I work from home so it rarely leaves the house anyway! but yeah, if you live on the beach or on a swamp or something this may not be the phone for you!Overall though, I LOVE this phone! And maybe I'm just too scared to make the step to a smartphone (it's just like 30 bucks extra a MONTH!) but I'd rather use that extra $360/ year on a new PS4 or something thank you.

B004OQDXRS,1329177600,"This phone is ok except that, due to a defect, the battery life may be wildly inconsistent.  On my phone, the battery may last 4 or 5 days without use, but at random intervals, it may drain in about 3 hours.  This also seems to affect the long-term battery life, so that it will have to be replaced every 3 to 4 months.Most of the time, the battery works fine.  Only problem is that you never know when it will suddenly drain quickly.  As a result, you can never depend on this phone.  When it drains, you have to remove the battery, put it back in and recharge the phone.  Normally, it will then hold a charge... but you never know when it will suddenly drain again.I see there are several complaints about the touch screen.  I have also had this problem but found that sliding the phone open and pressing a number on the keypad makes the touch screen work.

For over 9 years, I have struggled with phones that drop calls CONSTANTLY and lose network connection when I simply went into most buildings. I'd have to go outside to get the phones to reconnect to the network. This was not the answer, for many times, the network would not connect unless I turned the phone off and on.  However, this did not work everytime. In my house, there are only two places I could have any type of conversation.

The description of this phone says the screen size is 3.1"" that is not true, but I knew that before I purchased it by reading the reviews.  The total screen size is 2 1/2 x 2"" and the size of the phone is 4 1/4 x 2 1/4.  Of course the screen size on this phone is not as large as the HTC Evo or I phone, but it suits me very well.  I wasn't expecting everything that you can do with this phone, so I was pleasantly surprised.  You can set up you email accounts and the phone will alert you to when you have new messages.  There is a gps that works pretty well even though the screen is small.  You can download apps for the android market.  I haven't downloaded but a few and so far I have had no problems.  I saw one review that said Angry Birds did not work for this phone because of the screen size, but I have no desire to play it on a screen this small.  I have downloaded UNO and it works pretty well.  The graphic of the screen are descent and the colors are bright.  The camera is not the best but it is not bad.  Pictures look best when you take them in bright light and are still. You can view pdf documents and make them larger.  Of course you have to move them around on the screen to see the whole document.  Calls are clear and the ringers are very loud.  The speaker phone is descent also.  You can hear the person you are talking to really well and they could hear me... so that was a plus.  One of my favorite things about this phone is I can say ""call Jackie"" and it dials the number for me!  You can also say something like ""directions to Nashville, TN"" and it pulls up the directions!  The keys are really small, but surprisingly input is pretty accurate.  This phone has the 'Swype' input system so that makes it really easy to type a text message.  Swype is an entry method where you place your finger on the first letter of the word you are typing and just slide it from letter to letter.  It works pretty well.

They took $50+ dollars out of our account because the number they assigned us was previously assigned to a deadbeat, so every time we added $$$, Whoosh, it was gone again. Their CS people are rude and uniformed.  They will contradict each other and when you complain they aren't helping with your question or problem, they just hang up, or they put you on hold for a supervisor who never comes on the line.  No, they are not in Bangladesh, but they are worse if that is conceivable.  I finally went to my local store and the counter rep tried to talk with the CS people and she was hung up on twice!  When calling in you go thru the punch 1, punch 2 over and over and then after finally getting a live person and explaining your problem, the say ""Oh gee, that's not my area and switch you to another rep with whom you must explain your problem once again from the beginning, only to have that rep say Oh gee, that's not my area and immediately switch you to another line on hold, etc. etc. This happens every time I called.

B0057JAQXU,1309824000,"I decided to take the plunge and purchase a smartphone. After a lot of research I decided to go with T-Mobile's Samsung Dart and I must say, it is worth the price. Not only does this phone work as a contract phone, it works with prepaid plans. Since it runs on Droid software you have access to all the Droid apps. The wifi ability is simply amazing. Anywhere I go that has a wifi connection the phone will automatically use my wifi connection so that I don't use the data from my data plan, not to mention it's faster. I can also make calls through my wifi! The resolution is excellent, the sound quality is very clear, although I must admit that the iPod/iPhone does have a slightly better sound. The camera is a 3.1 megapixel camera which takes very clear and crisp photos. The GPS is just as good as my Garmin that I purchased last year. The phone comes with software to open pdf's and the Microsoft suite file types. The Swype keyboard software makes typing and texting FAST on a little digital keyboard, simply drag your finger from letter to letter and it will automatically figure out the words and throw in spaces for you.It's about time a good phone came out for us prepaid folk.Regardless weather your prepaid or contract, I highly recommend buying this phone if your looking for a smartphone to check email, Facebook, carry documents, listen to music, access the internet etc....UPDATE - 11/6/2011 (subtracting 1 star from rating)After owning this phone for almost 5 months I thought I would throw in an update that I felt people should know about. I love this phone, however, after owning it for awhile I did come across 1 issue that bugs me. The screen size is just a hair different than most smartphones. This makes a number of apps in the Android Market incompatible with this phone. Although there are not many apps that are incompatible, it is frustrating if you come across one.I would actually steer you towards the LG Optimus T if you want a prepaid/contract smartphone, as it does everything this phone does but is compatible with all the apps this phone can't handle.

B0057JAQXU,1321401600,"It's a shame that my first Amazon customer review has to be a negative one, but the defective product I received and the poor service I've received following must be reported.I ordered this product based on the fairly good ratings it had on both Amazon and T-Mobile's website. I ordered it specifically because it is supposed to access WiFi.After I had activated my SIM card at a T-Mobile retail store, the first thing I did was check the WiFi; it said ""disconnected,"" even though it recognized the WiFi that's available in my house. I searched online and found that this seems to be a common problem among Samsung phones in the U.S. I tried all the solutions that other people had suggested in forums: ""forgetting"" the wireless network and re-inputting it, rebooting the phone, performing a factory reset. Nothing.So, I contacted a Samsung technician via livechat. He 1) spoke very poor English and 2) seemed less familiar with wireless products than I am. That was of little help.I then contacted a T-Mobile customer service representative. We went through the steps to check and see if it was an issue with the phone's APN settings, or my wireless internet; the APN settings seem to be functioning correctly, and my router also has no problems. She said this must be an issue with my internet service, but after speaking with two IT technicians, temporarily disabling the security settings and changing the encryption key on my wireless network, we've verified that my wireless internet is not the source of the problem.Finally, I spoke with an Amazon customer representative to see about returning the product but keeping the SIM card. I've activated my account already, and T-Mobile has a policy where if you use their ""No contract"" prepaid plans, you must use the plan for 6 continuous months or face a cancellation fee; so in fact, it is not a ""no-contract phone,"" it's a 6-month contract phone. This is why I wanted to keep my SIM card. The Amazon customer representative said he could not help me, and a wireless specialist would email me within 24-48 hours. Amazon customers are not allowed to chat or phone with wireless specialists.So, basically, Amazon sent me a defective product that neither its manufacturer, Samsung, or the phone company it's connected to, T-Mobile, can fix. And they're making me wait 2 days to see if I can even return the phone.If one of your prerequisites is to get a phone that needs to access WiFi, other than the GalaxyS, I can't recommend Samsung products. And I don't know if I can trust buying any wireless products from Amazon anymore, after the poor customer service I've received.=========An update. I added a star for the exemplary service I got from Amazon WIRELESS; NOT Amazon.com. To explain:As I said, the Amazon live chat representative told me to wait 24-48 hours to hear from Amazon wireless. After waiting the first 24 hours, I decided to try to call Amazon.com customer service myself, thinking that my question (that I wanted to return the phone, and if I could keep the SIM card or not) was simple enough that an Amazon.com customer rep could call the Wireless team and get back to me with an answer.The customer rep I spoke to said she didn't know the answer to my question, but she DID give me the phone number to Amazon wireless, saying they would be more qualified to help me. When I explained my problem to the customer rep there, he said that because I had ordered my phone through Amazon.com, NOT Amazon Wireless, that I needed to direct my question to Amazon.com.""But two different Amazon.com people said that I needed to talk to Amazon wireless to resolve my issue.""The guy put me on hold for about 5 minutes, and then he was gracious enough to answer my question about the SIM card (you can keep it, by the way), AND he sent me a return package label, all when I wasn't an Amazon Wireless customer, but an Amazon.com customer.So, a sort-of-thumbs down for Amazon.com: it took two customer service reps for them to send me to someone who would help me, when they were supposed to be helping me from the start. And a big resounding thumbs-up to Amazon Wireless for helping me even when I wasn't an Amazon Wireless customer.Lesson learned?

B0057JAQXU,1328400000,"I bought this phone on Feb 1, and have had a few issues with it, most of which have either been resolved, or I have learned to accept.The first thing I noticed when turning the phone on (and off) is T-Mobile's ""Stick Together"" animation that appears and has the audio level set so loud that it distorts the speaker on the phone.  In order to save my eardrums I called tech support and was told that there was nothing that could be done about it, which angered me until I discovered that the volume for this could be adjusted in the ""system audio"" settings.  I found it strange that their support people didn't know how to do this.The second problem was when I tried to pair the phone to the bluetooth in my car's audio system.  I got the message that the phone was paired to my car, however the voice control in the car didn't work.  I later discovered that you need to drag down the notifications bar during the pairing process to download the phonebook.  The only other issue, is if you use your google contacts and type them in Firstname, Lastname in your contact list, in my car, a 2011 Elantra, I have to say the Lastname first in order for the voice recognition to work.  Not sure if this is true for all cars, but I didn't have to do that with my previous phone from Straight Talk.This morning when I turned on the phone there was a big yellow triangle on the screen and a message that said ""downloading"", which never went away.  I called tech support and they helped me reboot the phone which cleared out all my data.  He said I must have hit the volume and power buttons at the same time, which is easy to do because they are on opposite sides of the phone right where it is natural to hold it.The biggest problem I am having is that when the phone is shut off, voicemail picks up after 1 or 2 MINUTES!!...Or just goes to a busy signal after 1 or 2 minutes, which pretty much makes the voicemail unusable.  It does seem to work regularly when the phone is left on.I am undecided as to whether or not I will keep this phone or T-Mobile or not, but there are some pluses.  The Dart is like a poor man's Iphone in that it does much of what an Iphone does but the resolution isn't even close and the smaller screen size is noticable.  But, having true internet access on my phone is convenient...being able to sync my contact list off my gmail account is very cool...and being able to use wifi, especially for voice...is a huge advantage since my cell service sucks at home because of the terrain around us.I will play with the voicemail and consider leaving the phone on all day until bedtime so I can receive voicemail most of the time, which I think might be practical.  But, I would be curious to know if anyone else is having the same problem with their voicemail on T-Mobile.Except for the voicemail issue, I would recommend this phone for someone wanting a decent entry level smart phone. As for T-Mobile, they seem about as good as most other carriers...in other words they suck too.

I used to have a Blackberry and an expensive contract, no more.Phone worked well. For the GPS I had to download an app to get the spoken directions.

I had to pay 10 $ at ups for shipping to send it in. Store rep told me to take out the SIM card before shipping (and I needed it for my backup flip phone). When I got a phone in the mail two weeks later, the battery, back cover, and memory card were missing. I called customer service and they blamed me, I should have taken these off before shipping. The store rep had not said so. Phone rep said I should not only have gone to the store but also have called T-Mobile. Huh? They don't trust their store reps? She said they'd place a 'missing part search' that would most likely yield nothing, and I would have to pay for the missing parts. I went back to the store, and they gave me the missing parts. Beware, you don't get your own phone back, but someone else's refurbished. Gut it before sending it even if their rep says differently.When I had the contract, the T-Mobile customer service phone support was stellar. Knowledgeable, polite, native speakers, 24/7. Not so much when you go with month by month prepaid. I had to call twice. The reps aren't exactly polite, don't know much, have a verrrrry strrrrong accccent, possibly Russian, and are very hard to understand.

B0057JAQXU,1403395200,"Firstly, the Samsung Dart has served me well over the last almost three years...that is a lot of millage on cell phone.  It could probably serve me for a few more years just fine.  The phone was frustrating to me because it was &#34;just good enough&#34; for so long that I could not justify upgrading it.  During my three years of using it my only gripe was the 800 mhz processor.  With a 1 Gig processor I probably would have kept this phone longer.  Actually the true reason I'm leaving the Dart behind is T-mobile.  T-moble's service is decent, but I've had more problems over the years with their web site.  Stupid stuff like having a different requirement for password makeup than 90% of the websites out there so I was never able to use my standard passwords with it.  Often times their web site would not take my ATM card.  I never got auto-pay to work, and before you cry techno lamo I write sophisticated enterprise web applications for a living.  I think their web site has gotten a lot better, but logging on last night to make a payment and it not accepting my password was the last draw.  But I will miss my Dart, which is still a competent entry level smart phone so long as you aren't using it as your full time web browser (the slow processor and the smaller screen makes it kind of suck there).  Everything else, 4G, small size (except for web browsing), long batter life, durability all made me keep my Dart phone for a lot longer than my normally gadget oriented self would allow.  A great little phone.  Dated now...for the price you can get something with more features.  But if you can get one cheap and cheap is all you can afford the Dart might be worth it.  Also if you like a phone to be phone sized rather than quasi tablet size, this phone might be for you.  It will run apps but forget it for 3D gaming.

B0057JAQXU,1314230400,"I purchased the Dart on sale for $100 directly from T-Mobile and have had this phone for over a month.Battery life, as with most Android phones, is average.  With regular usage, I need to charge daily (I keep the charging USB cable in the office and the AC charger at home).  The camera isn't particularly good, but I don't mind since I have a dedicated point-and-shoot for doing serious photography.  If you are looking for 4G support, also note that this supports 3G only.  That said, I am using the Dart without a data plan, relying solely on wi-fi, which works great.The screen size on the Dart is smaller than most, but keep in mind that this phone has a very small footprint (see photo).  Having carried an LG Env2 previously, I opted for the Dart specifically because of its small size (see picture) as I wanted something that would fit comfortably in my pocket.  The downside of this, however, is that some applications (e.g. Words with Friends, AnyStop) are not supported by the Dart.I thought I would miss having a physical keyboard, but Swype works great for texting, and speech-to-text works reasonably well, too.PROS: small sizeCONS: average battery life, not-so-great camera[UPDATE 03/27/2012]I am still mostly satisfied with this phone (small size is its best feature IMO) but thought I'd add a few more observations.1. Internal app storage is somewhat lacking.  Naturally, I tried moving whatever apps I could to the microSD, but this is a limited solution.  I have not rooted the phone (and have no desire to do so) but am running the stock Android distribution.Running the DiskUsage app shows 177 Mb of internal memory, and I usually have about 20 Mb free, which is close to the threshold of triggering the low memory error.  I don't install an inordinately large amount of applications (Touchdown, Maps, Facebook, and ThinkFree Office are the biggest space users) so encountering the warning from time to time can be an annoyance.  I typically deal with this by clearing cache for various apps.2. I flip between using 3G and WiFi, disabling one or the other in an attempt to maximize battery life.  Sometimes this results in the phone entering a state where enabling WiFi returns an error repeatedly.  Usually, this can only be resolved by rebooting the phone.  I don't know if this is specific to Froyo or the Dart.3.

B0057JAQXU,1318896000,"I purchased two of the Tmobile (Samsung) Dart because I was considering switching from Sprint to T-mobile.  After I noticed several issues (which I'll discuss shortly), I returned them and purchased one more from Amazon.com a few weeks later, just to be make sure that I didn't get two from a bad batch.The phone has a nice form factor.  It is very small and thin, and takes up almost the same amount of space in my pocket as my very old Motorola RAZR.Unfortunately, the screen resolution is very poor, making it difficult to read text that appears in the default font.The battery tended to drain very quickly, which is surprising for a GSM phone.I also noticed that the Wifi data access was hit and miss.  Even though I had a strong Wifi connection, the phone would sometimes report having no data connection and then work again just as suddenly.I tested the two phones that I purchased and both experienced the same problem.  And then I purchased one more from Amazon.com, just to be sure.  The intermittent data connnectivity problems, low screen resolution, and poor battery life persisted.As bad as the phone is, however, the Tmobile customer service is even worse.  One of the features that really interested me was Tmobile's Wifi Calling feature, which lets you make and receive calls using your Wifi Access Point.  This is important to me because my house has very poor reception with all carriers.Although this phone is listed on Tmobile's web-site as supporting that feature (and the box specifically says that it is supported), I was never able to get it working.  Each time that I tried activating it, I received an error message (often a different one from the time before).I went online and found a number of complaints of similar problems in Tmobile's support forums.  Most had no solution posted, and the one that had a solution posted didn't work for me.I called T-mobile's technical support at least seven times in an effort to get the feature working.  In total, I spent over five hours, mostly on hold.  Most of them repeatedly asked questions that suggested that they didn't understand how the feature worked.  Each time that I called, I waited on hold for between 15 and 20 minutes before I was able to speak with a representative.  Most of the calls were answered by agents with heavy accents.During two of the seven calls, I was told that this phone doesn't support the Wifi Calling feature at all (even though the Tmobile's web-site says that it does and the phone has the app necessary to activate and configure the feature).One of the seven times that I called, I was actually transferred to five different representatives, with each one telling me that they couldn't help me, but that the next one could.  Ultimately, I ended up talking to a representative in the U.S. who said he could not help me either, but that he could transfer me back to the prior department (that had sent me to him).On two of my seven calls, the representative hung-up on me.  During two of the other calls, I asked that my call be escalated, and I was told that Tmobile technical support has no escalation procedures.On one of my calls, I was able to reach a supervisor.  She advised that the SIM card that I was using did not support Wifi calling and had me switch to another SIM Card.  After I switched, the service still didn't work.  She said that it could take up to two hours to provision, and that she would call me back in 2 hours.  She never called, and the service still does not work.I also attempted to call the local Tmobile retail store, and they told me that they could offer no assistance at all, other than referring me back to technical support.I also called Tmobile's corporate HQ in Bellevue, Washington, and was transferred to a Executive Customer Service Team voicemail, where I left a message that was not returned for several days.  Ultimately, a man called back.  He promised to investigate the matter and get back to me within a week.  Although I've called him back twice and left messages on his voicemail, I haven't heard from him since.",1,"10 18, 2011",Awful Phone and Terrible Tmobile Customer Service,Cell Phones,Samsung Dart Prepaid Android Phone (T-Mobile),99.99,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 30440},Samsung,Cell_Phones,-0.268613,0,0

B0057JAQXU,1321401600,"I finally decided to join the smartphone bandwagon, but I refused to pay $70, $80 or even more for a data plan--like a lot of people I know do. I did a little research and found that T-Mobile had some very affordable plans (as do some other carriers), as long as you buy your own phone. Now, ever since I first owned a cell phone (around 1999), I have ALWAYS gotten the ""free"" phone that comes with a 1- or 2-year contract. But after comparing the cost of buying the phone from a 3rd party retailer (like Amazon) I realized I would be saving literally hundreds of dollars if I opted to forgoe the ""free"" phone route. This is of course because the identical plans that accompany ""free"" phones are basically $20/month more. Simple math: 24 months x $20 = $480!This review is supposed to be about the phone of course, but the point of why this phone is so great is tied into the fact that it is cheap, and allowed me a super-affordable entry into the world of smartphones. I'm not going to go into a ton of details about the phone, because I can't compare it side-by-side with other smartphones. But here are the things I really like about this phone:Design: It's really small and light, and yet very sturdy. The touch screen is amazingly precise, and the design of the operating system/software (whatever you want to call it) is fantastic. It's easy to use, and very intuitive. And it does a TON of things.Features: Again, I can't provide a detailed comparison with other phones, but I do know I love the features the Dart has. Some of them are basic, like quick checking of weather and news, the camera/camcorder, and access to the internet (ESPN, email, or anything else you want). But I was amazed by the voice-command function (which I didn't even realize it had until I bought it). This allows you to say basically anything into the phone (an address, a restaurant/store, or a website), and it very accurately displays what you say (I would estimate it gets 95% of what you say correctly, which I think is very impressive), and then displays links to maps or websites. I walked out of work the 2nd day I had the phone, spoke the name of a local deli, clicked the displayed phone number, and ordered my food. I thought that was pretty freaking cool! Other great features are the ""swype"" text feature, which makes texting super fast, the walking/driving navigation (which some people had told me costs extra money to activate for their phones--but this is free), and of course the android app store is great since there are so many free apps to download.I bought this phone for $143 from Amazon (I think I've seen it even cheaper since then), and I pay $50 a month for unlimited voice, text and data. It's true that I get only 100MB of data before the 3G speeds (which I find to be really fast) slow down to 2G. But I LOVE having no contract, and for my purposes even the 2G speeds are fine. The only substantial difference is that at 3G you can download videos and broadcasts quickly, and with 2G you are looking at several minutes for a 3-4 minute video). But everything else functions pretty well at even the 2G speed. And of couse I could upgrade my data plan by either: 1) going for the 2-year contract at the same $50/month, or 2) staying on the monthly plan and paying $60/month. For now, however, I am perfectly happy with my current plan, and I really love the phone.I finally entered the 21st century, and I'm doing it for $50/month!Quick Update 2/13/2012The phone also has Wi-Fi capability, so I'm able to connect with my wireless network at home and anywhere else there is an open Wi-Fi connection. When your Wi-Fi is enabled and connected the data usage does NOT count against your monthly allotment. This makes it very easy to stay under 100 MB/month.I've had the phone about 4 months now, and I still love it!",5,"11 16, 2011",My first smart phone--and I love it!,Cell Phones,Samsung Dart Prepaid Android Phone (T-Mobile),99.99,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 30440},Samsung,Cell_Phones,0.323987,0,0.323987

So this is more of a very minor one off solvable issue than anything.The second is that the phone operating system needs to be upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 7.5 (Mango). This requires downloading and installing Microsoft Zune on your computer, hooking your phone to your computer, and checking for upgrades. The upgrade process also takes 30-40 minutes.

All in all it's a very nice interface. I prefer over Apple and Droid.The phone itself is great. Looks nice, fast, expandable memory, the camera takes a decent picture and battery life is quite good.The apps selection is okay but their interface is quite different from their Droid and Apple counter parts. Yelp for example is bizarre to use when compared to the latest version on Apple or Droid. It uses a Windows phone style interface which has a different screen flow. I don't think 3rd party apps have a good grasp on how to develop for this platform. I will say the app selection is improving though. If you love apps I'd probably skip this phone. If you need a phone for email and Facebook this phone will work very well for you.Bing maps works well in the US but not as well in Canada as Google maps.

B004H23JXW,1315526400,"I've been using the Focus for about three months now and it's honestly by far the best phone I've ever owned. The screen is gorgeous, the WP7 OS is responsive and intuitive, and most of all it actually works as a phone! As a previous dedicated Iphone owner, I can say that I have absolutely no regrets in switching, and I can see the jealousy of my family (who are still Apple nuts) whenever I let them mess around with the interface.The only cons I can put against it are that it only comes with 8 gigs initially (which is just ridiculously low these days), but I stuck another 16 in with an sd card I had lying around. Some people seem to be having an issue with not having their cards work, but I've never had a problem. Also-and this is incredibly minor-there's no gapless playback on the Zune software. I know only about 5 people will actually care (or even notice), but it's slightly irritating at times.In it's current state, I would already put the Focus and WP7 at the cream of the mobile crop, but with the Mango update coming in a week or two, I really can't see any other OS coming near to holding a candle to it.

B004H23JXW,1327536000,"I just got this phone 2 weeks ago for my parents and I wanted to compare it to the iPhone 4 which I personally use. I disagree with the other reviewers here who say that the phone is better than the iphone 4. Here are the reasons why:The screenThe iPhone has a much higher resolution display at 960/640 packed in a 3.5 inch screen. The Focus has a 800/480 screen in a 4 inch display. Some people will say ""4 inches is definitely better than 3.5 inch"" but it has less pixels than the iPhone and the pixels are spaced farther apart thanks to the bigger screen. What does that mean? Images and text look a lot less sharp on the focus compared to the iPhone. After using the iPhone, I don't think I can ever accept anything less in terms of screen quality. But if videos are all you watch, then you'll probably enjoy the focus more.FunctionalityThe apps on the iPhone are tremendous, and I am able to use it for whatever purpose that I can imagine be it calculations, looking up drugs, booking my vacation, etc. I work in the healthcare setting and robust medical apps like medscape and epocrates are scarce on the windows platform. I also like to use google voice to text via 3G, and there's no official google app for this phone. There's virtually no incentive for google to develop an app for this phone since only 1-2% of the smartphone population has windows phones. App developers probably have the same view. So unless you're just into posting your status on facebook (the integration which is nice btw), this phone may not be able to accomplish many tasks in your life. Not yet anyway...Camera:With skype around the corner for the windows platform, it will suck since the focus lacks a front facing camera. The iPhone has one. So you'll be limited to voice calling only.ExperienceThe experience on both phones is different, but very nice. None of the phones are plagued by any jittery behaviour or crashes. I think both phones are miles ahead of android in terms of having an overall smooth experience. It is for this reason that I think microsoft has something truly amazing and will not send windows phone to the trash can. I admit, the tile system of windows is kind of strange at first glance and may hamper adoption of the platform because one does not see conventional ""icons."" But when Windows 8 comes out for the PC and more and more people are exposed to the metro interface on their notebooks, a windows phone won't seem so alien anymore and may speed up its success in terms of app development.Bottom line:I think it's safe to say that this phone is a long term investment since many great apps on iOS and android aren't available yet. That's the only thing holding windows phones back. You can easily overlook the other shortcomings since this phone is so cheap for being unlocked, which is the reason why I got it for my parents.",4,"01 26, 2012",Samsung Focus,Cell Phones,"Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)",93.68,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 12309},Samsung,Cell_Phones,-0.0223228,-0.0055807,-0.0167421

B004H23JXW,1368921600,"I have owned a Samsung Focus for two and a half years now. It was my primary phone until the Lumia 920 came out in November. Since then, I keep my Focus around when I travel out of the country and in situations where I would not want my primary phone to get lost or damaged.My first Focus lasted over 18 months, surviving frequent drops, tosses, pockets with keys, heavy rain and other disasters. This is much better than any cell phone I had used up until that point. I finally managed to crack the screen dropping down some cement steps.  I replaced it with an HTC Surround, which barely lasted 4 months under the same conditions. After the HTC phone died, I went and got a new unlocked Focus on Amazon.Though tough, the phone is a finger print magnet. It also feels really cheap and lightweight. For all their cool kit inside, Samsung never produced a phone that looks and feels as expensive as it is.The hardware on the phone was great in 2010, and still feels pretty good today. The AMOLED screen is bright and very vibrant but a little pixelated. The Sound is pretty good. The phone uses NAND memory, which is faster than many SD card based phones. There is an expandable SD card slot (the only Windows Phone 7 device to have one), and the removable battery is a huge plus when traveling.Tinkerers will like the Focus too. That SD card comes in handy, and the unlocked boot loader allows you to flash custom Windows Phone ROMs. You won't be getting Windows Phone 8, but you can flash to 7.8, however. Right now, there are only a few games and apps that require WP8 (Temple Run, Modern Combat 4 are two examples).At $100, this phone is less than half the cost of a budget Lumia 520.

I don't have a high-end data plan so I'm not so concerned about this.

B004H23JXW,1324166400,"I have been using this phone for about two months by now. Before I bought the Samsung Focus I owned the HTC Surround, Apple's iPhone 3GS, and HTC Touch Pro. I will review not just the phone, because I think the OS is also very important when talking about a WP7 Phone.Dimensions and Characteristicsthe screen size is bigger than iPhone's 3G or 4G. Talking about image quality, I prefer the Focus, the image is brighter and color look awesome. This phone is really slim and light, the opposite of HTC Surround, which is much thicker and heavier because of the sliding speaker. The built in camera is good and you have a good flash light also which is nice to have when taking pictures in dark ambience, but of course, the image quality is much lower than using a digital camera.User InterfaceMicrosoft has done a great job redesigning the screens in WP7 (now WP7.5) with ""Metro"". You will see that the icons (which are called tiles) in the main screen are ""alive"" and are not static icons like the iPhone or Android or Blackberry. The tile gives you information about your contacts or a group of contacts (updates from Windows Live, Facebook, My Space, Messenger, Twitter and LinkedIn). Now many applications are using live tiles to give you specific information so don't have to launch the app to see some important information. Also live tiles make the main screen more attractive... I like them.Zune vs. iTunesAfter using iTunes for several years, I just realized that if you don't have an Apple's computer, then you will have some troubles using iTunes (at least that's my experience). I have to say that I like Zune much more than I like iTunes. Zune is all about multimedia, the user interface is really nice, full of watermarks which change depending of what you are viewing and that makes you enjoy using the software, the opposite feeling when I use iTunes which I consider boring and I use it because I have to in order to synchronize my iPod.TouchscreenI think Focus' touchscreen responds better than iPhone's 3GS or 4G. The screen responds incredible fast (compared to iPhone) and touch is very accurate (much better than I got in Touch Pro... I can't even compare them!)Marketplace vs. AppstoreIn Ecuador the items you can purchase from Appstore is very limited due copyright terms (but Apple opened many items last week for Ecuador). In US you will find a lot of more applications in Appstore than Marketplace, even though Microsoft is doing a great job with developers, but there is a long way to go. I would really like to have applications in Marketplace like Google Maps (even though you have gMaps) and Skype (which has been announced to be delivered be the end of 2011). If you think the applications are something really important when you have to pick your phone, then I recommend that you look at Zune or Marketplace if those applications you really like are available for WP7. If the application is not in available, then you can check at developer's forums if there are any plans to develop the software, but now you can find almost every great application in WP.KeyboardIf you are used to type using a built-in keyboard (like Blackberry 9300 or similar), then you will have some troubles while you get used to type on the screen. iPhone's and HTC's keyboard work pretty much the same, both respond fast and the size of the letters are good enough to type without making many mistakes. You can turn on the grammar checker that helps you to correct misspelled words (several languages now with Mango Update). Even though 99% of the time I write in Spanish, I have to say that the spell checker works great.Office HubI expected more from WP7 Office hub. The office applications are extremely basic and I still don't know how to synchronize documents from the phone to the PC (without using Skydrive), or transfer files from the PC to the Phone.ConclusionIn conclusion, I am not an expert about phones; but I have used several models and OS and I really like WP7 (which is completely different of Windows Mobile. WM was the worst OS I have used!).With Mango Update (also known as Windows Phone 7.5) you can create groups of your contacts and pin the group to the home screen. Since you can link information from Messenger, Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter of your contacts, live tiles will tell you if anyone of your contacts in the group has shared something in any of those networks and you can make any comment or share anything you want without using any app, because everything is integrated in the OS, but not everything is perfect, now I have to charge the phone twice a day, actually now I have a charger at home, at office and the car (I hope there is a way to fix this because the battery lasts some time 5 or 6 hours, if you play a game then it will last 1 hour).In the Message Hub now you can send messages not only using the regular SMS, you can send messages to your contacts in Messenger and Facebook Chat. The phone will let you know if the contact you are writing to is connected to one of those two networks (or both), otherwise it will suggest sending a regular SMS.I am really happy with this phone and I don't find any reason to go back to iPhone or change to Android. I also think this phone is better than HTC Surround due to a better screen, is lighter and has a better camera.",5,"12 18, 2011",Really great phone,Cell Phones,"Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)",93.68,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 12309},Samsung,Cell_Phones,0.245817,0.18436275,0.06145425

I had to download those things because the phone is pre-loaded with AT&T proprietary apps and no AT&T account, no working apps.  The nicest surprise I got was that Windows office is preloaded.  I had to set up Skydrive on my both my home PC and the phone but now I can download and edit documents (word, excel, powerpoint) whenever I like.  What wasn't nice was that cellular data connection wasn't working.  At first I was blaming it on the phone not being unlocked but that wasn't the case, a call to Consumer Cellular support and 5 minutes later I was using my cellular data connection to the web.  So, bottom line:  its not going to be perfectly set up out of the box and may require working with your carrier service but once its set up, its great.  If you have to consult with your cellular carrier you'll need your IMEI number.  It'll speed things up if you already have it and you can get it by dialing *#06# on your phone and writing down the number for their use. Oh, you need to install ZUNE onto your PC, I'm not particularly impressed with it but its no big deal, I only use it to sync music anyway.",5,"01 23, 2013",Really impressed with the phone and Windows 7.5,Cell Phones,"Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)",93.68,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 12309},Samsung,Cell_Phones,0.0656451,0,0.0656451

B004H23JXW,1328054400,"I had an iPhone 3G for almost 3 years and was pretty certain I was going to upgrade to the iPhone 4S, but after playing with a friend's Samsung Focus for a bit, I figured I'd give Windows Phone 7 a try.  I was able to purchase this phone without contract for the same price as purchasing a new iPhone 4S from ATT and extending my contract.  I just popped my SIM card in and I was good to go--my grandfathered-in unlimited 3G iphone plan worked perfectly.The device itself is great.  The construction is mainly hard plastic--which versus the iPhone's glass and metal, initially felt cheap to me, but its holding up well even after taking a few spills and SO much lighter than the iPhone.  Nice curved edges and a slight taper from the top to bottom are nice design touches and make the device really nice to hold.  The 5MP camera takes great pictures (flash works suprisingly well) and the 720p video is great.  The 4 inch AMOLED screen is almost unbelieveable sharp and the colors are incredibly vibrant.  If you have never seen an OLED screen, you will be suprised at how nice it looks.The OS is where this phone really shines.  Yes, the appstore is lacking a lot of the popular apps that I loved on the iPhone, but it is getting better.  The OS is super responsive, scrolling is super smooth, animations are consistent, pinch-to-zoom is just as good as the iPhone (and much better than the Android devices I've used).  The Zune media player is great (even has an FM radio) and I find the interface to be much more intuitive than the iPhone.For this price, you'd be hard to find a better unlocked phone.",5,"02 1, 2012",Awesome phone,Cell Phones,"Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)",93.68,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 12309},Samsung,Cell_Phones,0.639032,0,0.639032
B004H23JXW,1329868800,"First of all, let me begin by saying I was an early adopter of the iPhone, the first generation was a tank until dust got the best of it (under home button). Later on moving onto Android based phones and enjoying those as well. When there was a lot of positive feedback on windows 7.5 mobile and my other phone being drowned in beef stock. I decided to take the plunge with this little gem.Upon receiving the phone the packaging was no frills, and made me nervous. Before running the phone I charged the battery and installed an additional 8gb micro sd card I got for 19.99 (PNY MicroSD) because in the documentation WP7 takes over the SD card for good!The operating system takes up about 1.2 GB so keep that in mind.I love the fact that I can delete the ATT default applications since I am on TMobile pre-paid (50$ unlimited). Yes it is only limited to 2G (edge) speed.Updating the phones software was the only difficulty I had. While updating I got a backup error causing it to not update. I believe it was the front USB port I was using on my computer but at the same time I used a different Micro USB cable from my mytouch and plugged it in a usb port in the back of my computer. Once I did that I was able to apply the 2 updates through the Zune software (required)Anyway, setting up the phone was easy enough. Adding my google account synced up my contacts/calendar/email (important since I came from using android)Another important mention for tmobile users is that you have to go to the marketplace and install the Samsung Network Profile app and select tmobile usa.

No forward facing camera isn't a deal breaker for me, because If I wanted to video chat, I'll just do that at home on my computer (when I have combed hair. lol..)  I've had windows phones since the first windows mobile os (which wasn't good).  Now they have Windows Phone OS; And microsoft has learned from old mistakes.Since the Mango update Windows phone is awesome.  I love that It has office in the phone.  This feels like a real work phone. The Iphone felt like, well an Ipod with a phone built in.  I also love that I was able to add a 32gb SD card to up the memory. (It now has 36.6gbs free.) That means If I so please I can download movies or Xbox live games. :-) I was spazzing out on mirrors edge yesterday with the Focus. :-)  & the hd video may be only 720p but it's good enough to make quality youtube videos.  And it's flash is better than the Iphones flash.My choices were pay $$$$ for a new unlocked Iphone or unlocked Android or unlocked Blackberry, settle for a cheaper windows phone that only has 8gbs of rom, or get this older focus and upgrade it with the SD card.  For less than the price of a used Iphone 3g, I got a factory unlocked phone that can do all the same things, but adds microsoft office, an hd camcorder, and the biggest factor is that this phone asks before distributing all your private user information.Originally I was onboard for an android, then the same day I was going to get one, a consumer watchdog group out of Santa Monica California issued a request to the US Attorney asking that Google and Apple be sued for billions of dollars due to their letting app developers access all personal data on people's phones.  That, infact, is how many stalkers were invading celebrity cellphones. I'm not so worried about stalkers, but I don't like the thought of someone being able to hack my info just because I accidentally installed a shady app instead of angry birds. (and by the way even angry birds gets all your private info sent to them via Android & Iphone.)If you want to be in with the cool people and don't care about privacy issues or budget, go for an Iphone or an Android phone.  If you want a phone that will do all the same things but won't give free reign to any app developer that wants to hack your phone, and you want to pay $$$ less for an unlocked phone; The Focus is a very good choice.  Just remember to get the right SD card.  Many don't work, and because people wouldn't read and research to get the right one, many people complained that they couldn't get it working right.  Also many people didn't read the fact that the SD card intigrates into the OS, and therefore can not be removed or used to transfere files once it has been intigrated with the phone.  Due to so many complaints by people that just don't bother to read the directions, they stopped putting the upgrade slot on the newer phones.  That means the newer ones might have a better processor, but you have to go up to the most expensive models to even compete with the space you can have on this Focus i917.I may get another for my lady and retire her no privacy having Iphone. She already wants to trade. :-)Update May 1st, 2013:One month on and using the phone feels totally natural now. I have not lost any calls, had any crashes, or lost any data.Oh and I did replace her Iphone. She loves her Samsung Focus. Before she wouldn't risk her Iphone: she would switch sims and use a cheap flip phone if for example: we went to the beach or were going to ride on a boat or had an amusement park day. But now she uses her Iphone for the beach, flip phone is finally retired, and the Focus is protected & adorned.

B004H23JXW,1332979200,"I got this phone from ""Unlocked Cell Phone Kings"" and it appears to be just as new as it was advertised to be. It was a good value and connected to AT&T; very easily. I am using a $25/mo. off contract plan that allows unlimited texting and 250 minutes a month. The wifi connections have been very solid, so I am happy with that I decided to save 30 dollars a month while still getting the majority of the functionality I was looking for.Design: 4/5Overall I like the design. I would have liked it to be made out of more durable materials, but it certainly looks good. The front is a solid flat surface and the back is grayish with pin-striping that really is well done. The back is curved slightly, which helps to prevent it from being too slippery as it could be, with it being made out of smooth glossy plastic. The screen is very bright, but is made of plastic, so it could easily get scratched.Performance: 4/5It is fast enough. Downloads don't take long, and I have never seen a stutter. It upgraded to Mango without any issues using the Zune software I already had on my laptop. It plays Netflix perfectly with no noticeable pixelation or lag. It could load a couple of things faster, but overall load speeds are quite decent. The OS masks any slowdowns it might have by using fanciful transition effects.  Voice quality has been good, but there have been reports of echoing from people on the other end of the calls.Value: 5/5At $240 I will save $200 or more during my first year on AT&T;, and $400 or more during my second year.

B004H23JXW,1333929600,"I got this 1 month ago and I'm actually typing my review using it, so ill start with keyboard. Very good keyboard it is amazing. I had the HTC aria so the size difference felt so good in my hands, very tactile and the auto correct is really good it does its job!! It actually helps u type unlike some phones. The screen is astonishing, it pops out with such vibrant colors u feel like the picture is right in front of you. Video is also really good, I'd say it is equal to the iPhones except this has more vibrant colors, im in high school so I have alot of essays tht need to be typed and if my computer is ever being used I can type it up on this just as easy with Microsoft word. Xbox live is really good on this phone I can message my friends some games in the marketplaces gives you gamerscore!! On a side note if ur into minecraft their is a really good mobile alternative on here called survivalcraft. The marketplace has about 80,000 apps/games which is good enough for me even though it's about 400,000 less than android and iOS it has everything you need. As soon as I got my phone in the mail I updates it to windows phone mango and it is such a cleaner interface than android and it is alot better to look at than iOS. I was worried upgrading from 7 to mango would slow the phone but it's 1 GHz processor does the job amazingly! If ur into Facebook, twitter, windows live this phone is deff the best choice because it syncs everyone on ur friends list into ur phone and gives all their contact info they have available! I have 60-80 contacts in my last phone but when I synced Facebook (only social network I use) I have 700 some contacts! Also the pictures hub syncs all Facebook pics very neatly in with ur other photos. Talking about photos the camera is great its 5mp with 720p HD recording, my aria had 3.2mp with vga recording the difference was astonishing! It takes better pictures than the iPhone 4 in my opinion (not the 4s). Now the bad the battery life is mediocre I get about 7-8 hours of light use but I usually charge my phone after I get back from school around 2:30 p.m. I unplug it around 6:30 to start the day. But if I stay after school for anything I bring my charger because my phone will not last through that extra 2-3 hours. The other thing I dislike is its full plastic!! It is very lightweight, but it feels sort of flimsy and the plastic scratches easy, so I got a case which I recommend u get this case 2 its on amazon type in Samsung Focus Incipio Feather Case and I'll find it its about $15-$20 but it's worth it.

B004H23JXW,1391299200,"I don't use a smartphone much due to limited reception in my office area. But I like the features on a smartphone. So I didn't want to pay a lot or get stuck in a contract. I got this phone for about sixty on sale (wow, Amazon, that was pretty sweet!) and I'm delighted with it. It does more than my old Nokia X2 and I can always upgrade to full smartphone service if I need to. Right now, I have this on pay-as-you-go T-Mobile with my current SIM chip and don't do email or Web. I could change to PlatinumTel and even pay less on texting, and pay 10ct per 10MB of data--enough for email. I don't stream video or do internet on the phone--just need access to email on occasion.The setup was not bad, but took some time. I had the SIM chip (the T-Mobile) in the phone and was able to call and text. However, there was a bit of trouble with the reset--you hold the volume, the camera-on and the power buttons down simultaneously, and as soon as it vibrates, you release the power button but hold the rest until the REFORMAT screen appears. If you get the Download Mode Screen, you have to pop out the battery, power down (just powering down via the button doesn't work as it freezes at this point.) Then try again. I had to try quite a few times to get that screen up. The reformat is necessary for your SIM card to recognize the new phone.I was able to load the stored phone numbers from the previous phone, then access voicemail. The sound was a lot better than my previous phone and the operation on a touch screen is easy.I was not able to find a number of apps I wanted, as Windows Phone is not as popular as Android and that is not as popular as Apple. You'd think, with Windows OS being huge in computers, that there'd be more connectivity to phones, but it is definitely the 3rd best phone OS.

B004H23JXW,1362182400,"Time for the review. In short, I am very happy with my purchase. I was under the false impression that smart phones were very expensive and the data packages were still $20-25 extra a month. You CAN turn data on this phone OFF (Settings, Cellular, Data Connection) and just use the WI-FI but I chose to have a package that allows me some browsing at only $10 extra a month.This is with T-mobile.This phone does not come with a computer cord, and there is already an update available for it, so I strongly recommend purchasing a USB cable for it so you can update immediately. WITHOUT THE UPDATE, YOU CAN'T ACCESS APPS. The updates are free.I also could not get picture messages without downloading the app called Network Profile which is also a free app.Now that the apps and picture messages are working, I can safely say it is a very nice phone.After the update you can also voice text, which is the only thing I wished this phone had prior to me downloading the update. Now it does.This is a Windows operating system which means only Windows apps are available. You can't get Instagram, Snapchat, or a lot of other popular ones. When an app is created it's almost always made for Apple or Android products first, and Blackberry and Windows devices later, if at all. So that kind of sucks.The price on this phone tends to fluctuate.

B004H23JXW,1384646400,I was treating a family from El Salvador to a Justin Bieber concert in Guatemala and they told me that I needed to purchase an unlocked cell phone for my trip.  It was love at first sight.  This phone is so sleek. The instructions booklet says that you need to buy a micro memory card that is Windows compatible so I went to an AT&T store (since the phone says AT&T) and they tried to sell me a non-specfic SanDisk 32g micro memory card that made no mention if it was Windows compatible for around $60.  I went down the block to Radio Shack and they had an Ultra SanDisk 32g micro memory card that said it was Windows compatible for $28. I used the phone to call back home many times without any problems.  My friends took many photos and videos at the concert and they all came out crystal clear.  Even the ones that the kids took.  I had every intention on giving this phone to my friends when I was leaving to go back home.  It was the best purchase I ever made. I purchased it for less than $100 and it is worth so much more.  They love it and they use it every day.,5,"11 17, 2013",Incredible phone,Cell Phones,"Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)",93.68,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 12309},Samsung,Cell_Phones,0.35334,0,0.35334

B004H23JXW,1395100800,"If so, here you go. No, that is not an exaggeration.You see, a few months into ownership, this phone would prompt you to turn it offRandomly, without any contact to the power button. Sometimes while you aren't doing anything.Sometimes while the screen is locked.Reject it/Swiping away cause it to stall. Turning it off results in the same lack of turning on.Sure, you'll be able to turn it on. But it crashes before actually turning on.If you take the battery out, and put it back in, it will immediately start trying to turn on.It should not do this. When you put the battery in normally, it stays off until you power it on.Thus, it stalls again. My guess is your attempts to start it restart after doing this as well, because it seems to take a certain number of trys to get it to run.When its on the charger, the 3 bottom buttons lose functionality. You need those to do just about everything.You can hold the back arrow to access previous things you've been doing, but not while connected. you'll only get a single press.and then you have to wait 5 seconds to get another.Imagine trying to watch Netflix and someone texts you. You can only get that message shortcut if you do it RIGHT THEN.if you don't, you have to the app. but then with the time it takes you to get back to Netflix, you have another text.STILL RUNNING 7.5.

The Samsung Captivate (android phone) also has the same screen. If fact, Samsung is now switching all their future phones to use AMOLED.SOUND:The Speaker and call quality is very good. I have used a lot of phones and I can tell you this is the best yet. The speaker phone sounds just as good as a full size home phone. Compared to my daughters new iPod, the Focus speaker is way better, and she even admitted it.SPEED:Windows Phone 7 powered by the snapdragon 1GH processor is very fast. No lag, no screen delay, no issue flicking and scrolling. Fast internet browser as well.FEATURES:I am very impressed how polished Windows Phone 7 is, and I think its going to get better.

The Windows Phone 7 live tiles are so much better than old school icons on most other phones.SUMMARY:This phone is truly ahead of its time.

B004H23JXW,1330905600,"I am very satisfied with this phone. The only thing that could be better would be the availibility of phone settings. I think this is a limitation of the Windows Phone 7 O.S. On the one hand, since there are few settings, it is easy to set up. On the other hand, since there are few settings, you can not pick and choose when to use your data plan versus your WIFI during a specific action. It is on or off for WIFI, DATA, BLUETOOTH, AIRPLANE MODE. (My old Nokia had the ability to ask which network to use for every connection, which I liked.)While it defaults to WIFI when WIFI is present, it turns off WIFI in sleep mode to conserve battery life. I was kind of shocked to find that I used up 10 MB one night while I was asleep. A quick search finds this as a common complaint.I am on AT&T;'s Pay-As-You-Go plan, 10 cents per minute and I prepay for data, $5 for 10MB, $10 for 100MB, and $25 for 500MB. What I do is to pay $5.00 per month for the data plan, which rolls over my available data. This works out to about $100 every 6 months or so.There were no problems whatsover getting this phone up and running. It connects nicely with Microsoft's Skydrive. You can enter all of your contacts and calendar entries in Hotmail, and it syncs nicely with your phone, to give you a constant backup.Nothing bad to say, it looks great, there are plenty of apps available, and overall, it's a winner.Edit: There is one thing I'm not used to.

B004H23JXW,1336953600,"I'd really been looking forward to an escape from the Android OS and all the problems I had with it in the year since I began using my Samsung SG-I9000.  Apple's iPhone was tempting because of its functionality, but it was so overly-hyped and trendy I had many second thoughts about it.  I've used an iPhone here and there before and it was simple, but just didn't feel like something I wanted in the long-term.  Windows Phone was already on the scene but there were no stores selling them at the time where I live, so after reading review after review, I decided to take a leap of faith and grab the Samsung I917, aka the Focus.The GOOD:  First, the operating system is head, shoulders, torso, hips, thighs, knees, calves and ankles above anything else on the market.  It's just so simple and intuitive, not to mention beautiful.  And unlike Android, it's the exact same from device to device, so the user experience is consistent.  Zune integration is beautiful.  I can sync all my Zune music on my computer to my phone either by plugging in or over a wi-fi connection.  I can also download from the marketplace over the air and then sync back to my computer next time I connect.  The People tab is great because it lets me see what all my contacts are doing over social networks all in one place.  The phone is also physically beautiful.  I especially like the pinstriped back of the case.  The device is thin and light and quick (after all, it's basically a first-gen Galaxy S).The BAD:  The phone is pretty plasticy, and while it's actually pretty tough, I would really like to see Samsung put out a ""pro"" version made of duraluminum, like their Series 9 laptops are made of.  I'm pretty rough on my phones, watches, etc, so I always appreciate rugged versions of products when applicable.  The build quality is good but it just doesn't feel overly tough to me, which is the basis of my 4-star rating.The UGLY:  Windows Phone marketshare.  Seriously, this OS is so amazing, so beautiful, and so simple to use, this should have been 15% - 20% by now in my opinion.  Give this phone a chance folks, you'll be glad you did.

B004H23JXW,1383782400,"Returned this item for a refund, not only because it was defective, but poorly designed as well (despite what the experts say) and because the Microsoft 30-day free music download appears to be a deliberate scam.  As for the phone, the exterior Power On and Camera On buttons sometimes did not work.  The touchscreen button for taking photos sometimes did not work.  When positioning the camera lens, the screen constantly switches to a non-camera app, forcing you to start all over.  The onscreen keyboard is infinitesimally small, so mistakes are a constant.  As for the operating software, you cannot download the current Windows 8, but are stuck with Windows 7.  When I downloaded and started playing music (courtesy of the so-called free trial), the phone shut down but kept playing the songs, so I had to remove and re-insert the battery to regain control of the device.  When charging the device, the charge indicator screen never seemed to be the same one twice, and sometimes there was no indication at all of anything going on.  (I eventually discovered that there's a little pull-down indicator at the top of the screen, but initially thought the battery or the charger did not work.)As for that free music trial, I clicked the &#34;Cancel this subscription&#34; on the Zune Marketplace screen, after connecting the device to my desktop computer.  No sweat right?  Wrong.  This just takes you to Microsoft XBox login screen.  After entering your password, MS says it still needs to &#34;verify&#34; who you are by sending a code to your email address.  After retrieving and entering that, you select &#34;Account&#34;, only to find that there is no cancel option anywhere to be found.  The long, convoluted instructions for canceling provided by MS explain that you have to change your payment method first, although this guide doesn't correspond to the screens you actually see.  At any rate, after changing away from the automatic renewal option as instructed, there is no message indicating the trial is cancelled and you're not allowed to remove your credit card info from the system.  On another screen, you're instructed to call XBox to cancel a subscription. Going down this new rabbit hole, you're instructed to fill out a page with your request and provide your phone number so MS can call you in 2 minutes.  But after you submit the request, you get an error message saying it didn't work and you should try again later.  Boy, last time I check, this sort of con game involving interstate commerce was outlawed by the FTC.

Since the phone is branded to AT&T; (even though it is unlocked and can be used on any GSM network) you will simply not be able to get any updates on this phone until AT&T; decides to bless you with them (which in all likelihood based on their history, is NEVER).Also, the box that the phone came in was sealed, but did not have ""Samsung"" or ""AT&T;"" anywhere on the box except a printed out sticker.  The original Focus I got from Amazonwireless directly, had a normal flashy orange AT&T; box with Samsung written all over it.  The product manual inside of this new unlocked phone's box also suspiciously does not say Samsung or AT&T; on it.  To make matters worse, the little info sticker with the serial numbers on it below the battery does NOT say Samsung on it (unlike our first Samsung Focus directly from Amazonwireless did).  When I first got the package, it screamed COUNTERFEIT to me.  ***see update below***  But upon opening it, the phone appears to be constructed the same.  I powered on and set up the phone and then installed a Benchmark app on it, and it performs the same as my original Focus does.  To top it off, I called Samsung directly and told them about my concerns.  After describing everything to them and even giving them my phone's IMEI number (serial number), they assured me that it was a genuine Samsung product (but the representative had no explanation for why the packaging looked so suspicious).In any event, the phone itself is a solid 5 stars.  AT&T; gets 1 star for neglecting their customers by not allowing security and bug fixes on phones they offer (which is partially why we switched carriers in the first place).  But because of the update issue and the unusual packaging, I dinged the phone down to 4 stars.  But like I said, for an entry-level smart phone WITHOUT extending your contract, you simply cannot beat the price, and the whole Windows Phone system is a wonderfully refreshing alternative to Android and Apple (IMHO).***update*** I received the Focus and it appeared to work perfectly at the time I wrote the original review, but then when we tried to take a picture with the phone a week into owning it, there was a large yellow-discolored area in the center of the screen as if someone tried to take a picture of the sun or something insane like that and burned out the image sensor.  That got me thinking that perhaps the phone was refurbished rather than brand new (which might also explain the knock-off looking non-Samsung box).  I did some reasearch and have come to the conclusion that I almost certainly received a refurbished phone (an internet search on how to spot refurbished phones was VERY helpful).  The seller had good customer service though and sent us a label to send back the defective phone and sent another ""new"" one at no charge.  This ""new"" phone was actually in the factory Samsung box this time.  However, the box was scratched and the phone itself also had other tell-tale signs of being refurbished (although if I hadn't researched the topic it would have appeared brand new to me).  This time around, however, I ran diagnostics on the phone the moment I opened the box and set up the OS and everything seems to be working perfectly.  A final follow-up question to the seller about whether they might be getting supplied with refurbished phones instead of ""new"" phones from their supplier has so far gone unanswered, but I'm almost positive that's what is happening here.  I can't be too mad because the price we paid for the supposedly ""new"" phone was actually less than other sellers were charging for a refurbished phone, but a little bit of honesty here would be nice.  In any event, I encourage you to research how to spot a refurbished phone on the interet for more information.  In my non-expert opinion, in retrospect, I highly doubt any carrier-branded phone (i.e. with AT&T; logo on the front) can come factory unlocked.  So if you see a listing for ""unlocked"" and ""new"" in the same sentence, I personally doubt the accuracy of that listing and urge you to contact the seller in advance to double check.  When phones come back from the factory after service work, or they get refurbished to be resold, it is a well-documented fact that they are usually unlocked at THAT point.  So be forewarned, if a carrier-branded phone is ""new"" it is most likely locked, and if a carrier-branded phone is unlocked, it is most likely not new.  I have lowered the rating down to 3 stars due to what I think is likely inaccurate marketing.",3,"02 28, 2013","Windows Phone 7 is great, Samsung Focus is solid, DOES come unlocked, but has suspicious packaging",Cell Phones,"Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)",93.68,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 12309},Samsung,Cell_Phones,0.0649232,0,0.0649232

B004H23JXW,1321056000,"I have a google nexus one and we purchased the samsung focus to relace my wifes dying iphone. I did alot of research and decided on the windows phone based on the occasional clunkiness of android. Though I really like the iphone, it's just too muchh $$ and a contract.  We recieved the phone in new condition and at first having played around with it a little I really didnt like it that much. I updated to Mango which is cool, but it really took a week of playing with it to decide it really is a great phone. My wife uses her camera alot, and this one has a very good camera. I went out the other night and took some pics outside in the pitch black, I couldnt see what I was aiming at until the flash went off, but the pics were really good. Today we went to the beach as there was a big storm and we took pics side by side and the focus produced much better pics than my nexus one. There are a few things that I like better about android for sure. Live wallpapers for one, and the stupid colored tiles on windows. I mean really, gee I get to pick my color for by big tiles? thats it? I was hoping these ""live"" tiles would be like customizable to a much greater extent then they are.  The other thing I dont like is the app store. It's niether layed out as well, nor does it have that many apps compared to the compitition. So, why five stars? well really it's about the phone.

B004H23JXW,1322697600,"I purchased this phone a few days ago to replace my LG Thrive. I researched the phone to double check it is compatible with AT&T;'s GoPhone Prepaid program and sure enough it is (AT&T; sell this phone in their GoPhone section only at $499). The  phone was delivered the day after in good condition and it was sold by BLUTEKUSA.  The phone looks new and has no noticeable fingerprints or marks that would indicate it's been used, although the box it came in was obviously opened before. It came with the phone, charger, and a pair of headphones.The Samsung Focus is pretty easy to set up. It asks for date and time as well as a Windows Live ID which can be synced with later if so desired. The screen is beautiful, Super AMOLED making the display rich in brightness and color. There are physical buttons for the Power button, Camera, and Volume Control. It's plastic, so the phone is pretty light, although to the point where one might consider it cheap. The back is a thing plastic case that snaps onto the phone. Taking off the back is a bit on the scary side as I felt I might have snapped it the few times I tried. Overall the phone is a nice build just not one that screams high quality.The Camera takes really good pictures and I was impressed with the 720p video recording as well. Again, not high-end, but it's above average nonetheless.I updated the Samsung Focus to Windows Mango and the software is fantastic. The interface is easy on the eyes and is smooth. I have not seen any hiccups on this phone even though it only comes with 512mb ram, although that seems to be a restriction from Microsoft. To me, it has just as much polish as iOS (the operating system that the iPhone/iPad run) although it lacks a lot of the customization of Android (not really missing it).

B004H23JXW,1369008000,"If you are wanting to give a Windows smart phone a try this phone I highly recommend it. It's a nice solid phone. I've had mine for 4 months and I'm still pretty happy with it. The back is plastic with good looking pinstripes and some might complain that adding a certain cheapness to it but I disagree. It still looks great and very easy to remove if necessary and if made from metal would only increase overall weight and probably be a little trickier to remove having to line up slots just right. As it is it snaps off and on with ease. The overall feel is good and solid with nice curved edges making it a good looking phone as well. The 5 mega-pixel camera takes good pics too. The Super-Amoled touchscreen is great and easy to see in almost all light conditions even under a bright sun.The Windows os; as far as I can tell I like it. I can't comment on the Android or ios as I haven't used them. I can only say that what I've read is that Android is a mess. It is by far the most popular and looks like it will be for sometime. It appears that Google has very low if any standards in place for phone manufactures. Many of them with the hardware needed to fully run Android. Windows has placed standards on how Windows phones should be made so they run smoothly with little or no issues and at the same time keeping requirements at a level to keep accessible to most consumers. Most comments I've read about I phones is that while at one time cutting edge are not anymore as their platform is getting stale, have run out of ideas, running on brand only. Windows was designed with the user in mind to have an interface easy and intuitive to use and customizable enough for almost everyone and have become the one with the ideas now.There are some caveats I'd like to point out. The button placement could be better. The lock-screen button is directly opposite of the volume and too easy to press when trying to adjust volume. The light sensor works and locks the screen when making a phone call but not when putting it in a pocket or purse. It won't automatically lock itself leading to pocket calls, pictures of your pocket and voice commands. The only way to prevent this is to remember to press the lock-screen button. One of my fears is this button wearing out fast from having to use it so much. Most of these phones will be AT&T; phones so be prepared. They have Windows 7.5 and no plan or talk to release any update. There are several work-arounds to this. One being to plug phone in to computer, start the Zune software, click on phone update under the settings then unplug the internet connection from the computer after 2 or 3 seconds. It's real tricky to say the least and one that I couldn't ever get to work. There is a cab file to download on your computer and do it that way. The easiest is an application called seveneighter that will do the whole thing for you. I used that method a month ago without any problems.I recommend going to the windowsphone subreddit for any help you might need.

B00578HQAW,1315526400,"I've only owned the Samsung Infuse 4G (using ATT) for a few days, but it is truly an impressive device. I would strongly recommend it to anyone considering a top-line smart phone. Period.My smart phone history is (recently) six Dell Streak 5s (which is an amazing device, but with a few flaws), a Blackberry Bold 9000, and temporarily (recently) an LG540.Samsung Infuse is a beautiful phone. Vivid display (clearer and larger than any similar smart phone), logical functionality (16 Apps per page that scroll sideways), and the flexibility of Android.It's capacitive touch screen works very well, and the onboard memory (and capacity to upgrade) is excellent.The only weak point is the battery, but I've only had the device for days and it's not quite fair to criticize quite yet. However, having said that, it seems that if you allow all manner of back-ground programs to run (which is what will happen - unless you intervene), that you may spend some part of your day re-charging this device just to keep it alive.However, experience users (e.g., ATT reps who own this device, & other US citizens) advise me that selecting Task Managers (installed) or Market-available task managers (free), will extend your battery's life well beyond default settings. Not sure yet, but it seems the battery will last the majority of the day IF you are not using Wifi, GPRS-web, running onboard programs to the max, and/or talking simultaneously throughout your day. Perhaps all that activity is unlikely, but it's possible.Purchase a protective case immediately. This device is very thin, and its form-facter offers very little built-in impact-absorbing space (none), and you'll need to add some survivability to put your mind at ease. I selected the Case Mate, and it fits as tight as a drum head, but seems to offer some impact resistance; haven't tested it, nor do I want to.The Power-up key (top right) seems a bit of an odd place, but this probably prevents it from being pressed inadvertently. The volume rocker keys (top left) function as you would expect (up-loud, down-quieter), which is a breath of fresh air (Dell Streak varied its volume rocker functionality based on whatever direction its AutoRotation determined was UP - which I found very strange).This is only a quick ""First Impression"" evaluation. But I must say, I am blown away by the absolute beauty of the large 4.5"" display (not as big as Dell Streak 5, but much brighter and clearer), and the ease-of-use of Samsung Infuse. Infuse ships with a charger cable, wall adapter (no car power adapter is provided), an HDMI to phone plug (this phone will connect to your HDMI television for playback), quite nice ear buds (two extra different-sized ear bud sets), and a code sheet for one free HD movie. Loaded HD movies look amazing on this device, by the way.Email, Internet, Messaging, Phone use (speaker phone and handset, Application functionality, ""feel"" in-hand are all superb.I would buy this phone again. My competition was iPhone 4 (which has a lovely screen, but I found to be too small for the programs I use in my work: aviation weather programs; I'm not an Apple-hater, I own 9 Apple computers, but so far, I cannot cross the line into mobility with Apple; perhaps it is the iTunes strangle-hold that bothers me so much), Samsung Captivate, HTC Impress [all ATT so far], and US Cellular's offerings (nothing interested me), Sprint (same), Verizon's (all Droid phones - but their pricing was not attractive enough to swap service), and T-Mobile's smart phone offerings (which was/is very attractive - due to their cost-vs-benefit-%functionality ... and their unlimited data plans for 2 devices). Jury is not out yet, and the trial period for my ATT Infuse(s) has not expired.

B00578HQAW,1382572800,"I actually bought the Infuse to use as a media player, not a phone (I already have a Samsung S3 mini that I'm very happy with). With the high-quality Wolfson DAC built into the Infuse, and the VooDoo app support for the DAC, sound quality is amazing for both music and video. It doesn't have a &#34;Retina&#34; display, and some reviewers constantly knock Samsung Android device displays; frankly, I don't see a problem. The screen looks good with both video and graphics. Battery life has been good even when watching video; however, some games seem to eat more battery than others.The device is no longer getting any update support from Samsung, but it's easily rooted and there are plenty of ROM options out there on the XDA forum. Although Gingerbread was the last &#34;official&#34; version of Android on the Infuse, I'm running Jelly Bean via the Carbon ROM with no trouble whatsoever. With a 64gb microSD card in the expansion slot, I've got plenty of room for app data and media.The Infuse has been a great media player since I got it, and there's the added bonus of having a spare phone if something happens to my S3 mini. This phone is proof that you don't always need the absolute latest gear.

B00578HQAW,1367366400,"I owned this phone for about a year with NO PROBLEMS. It is just that I change out phones often as I am a techie and have to have the latest phone/tablet, etc. And so I upgrade very often. However, the phone worked perfectly for the time I owned it, so here is my detailed review, and I hope that it will help you make a good decision if you need a great smartphone at this great price!***Keep in mind that this Sim Unlocked phone will work fine in AT&T; and even T-Mobile for calling and texting. But for Internet and MMS, you may need to set the APN settings. If you need the APN settings for At&T;, T-Mobile etc, just ask me in the comments and I will send them.Pros:- Very clear and easy to read 4.5"" screen.- Outstanding colors and outstanding screen clarity.- 2.2 Android allowed me to save many installed apps on my SD External card. (Cannot do this anymore after OS 3.0 and higher).- Great camera - I took many high quality pictures.- Wonderful music player app (the stock one was just right and makes great playlists,etc). Sound quality excellent.- Got 4g on the Internet Data.- WiFi came in clear and fast.- Overall a easy to use and perfect size phone and comfortable to hold with big enough screen.Cons:- NO FM Radio. However, I installed Tune In Radio so if I had WiFi on, I could listen to all kinds of radio stations.- Could use more memory, yet it still ran fast for me.- It has OS of 2.2 Android, possibly 2.3. However, this is still a good OS and will run most Apps. I still have a Galaxy Player with 2.3 and all apps I installed run fine...Good phone, after owning it for about a year, I upgraded to Samsung Galaxy Note N7000 with 5.3 screen. However, that one was too large and heavy to hold and I upgraded again. However, at times, I kind of miss my old Infuse as it was big enough at 4.5"" and not a heavy phone to hold. And at the price offered, it is a good deal for a nice phone.Also, I am a techie and know a lot about Android devices that is smartphones and tablets, so if you have any questions, please ask me in the comment section.Hope that this review has been helpful to you and thank you for reading it.",5,"05 1, 2013","Very Beautiful Smartphone, Please Readon for Many Details",Cell Phones,Samsung Galaxy Infuse SGH-I997 Unlocked Global Android Smartphone AT&amp;T Wireless,169.99,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 46293},Samsung,Cell_Phones,0.581478,0.4361085,0.1453695

B00578HQAW,1333238400,"I am an advanced user and have been using this phone since past 3 months. This phone has an amazing huge s-amoled display which blows away all other phone displays I have seen till date. I have owned Blackberry,Nokia,iphone,etc but this phone is the best of all. I purchased this unlocked phone and rooted it immediately and installed custom Zeus rom (Gingerbread). It removed all the AT&T; bloatware and it can bump up its cpu speed from 1ghz to 1.6ghz with auto speed on demand setting as some graphic intensive games require higher processing power.Phone is incredibly slim so you need to buy a good case to protect it plus a scratch screen guard. Battery drains out quickly as the screen is a monster power consumer and phone heats up very very fast with GPS and screen turned on for longer periods. The sound quality is superb, display is super good and its on par with iphone its slim body.For advanced users like me, Iphone is really a piece of junk as I have customized each and every aspect of the phone which android allows and in my opinion, its far more advanced OS than anything in the mkt with tons of freeware available for downloads unlike paid apps from iphone. I am considering buying a second phone for my dad. At this price of under 350$, its a steal and it matches uptp 650$ dual core phones in the mkt with customized roms which can bump up the speed dramatically. It also has a state of the art GPU and phone is extremely fast inspite of loading it with so many apps. You can setup a wi-fi hub with your phone data connection too.

Very slow processor for its era, volatile battery life and general inability to cope with the demands of ICS made this the most regrettable smartphone purchase I've made.

B004QR0BG6,1327536000,"It's an Android phone that costs a bit more than 200 (at the time of order). Considering that it's a great phone.The resolution is HVGA (340x480), and while the screen isn't (by far) rich in details, paired with the digitizer (I think that's the name of the capacitive input piece) it provides a very nice touch feedback. I mean, on some low-end phones, the touch feels erratic (I'm looking at you, Galaxy 5), but not on this phone: it's as sleek as it gets on a phone with its limitations. To sum it up, the touch feels very fluid, which is a surprise.The internal storage is _the_ downside of this phone. You will fill it in no time when you start to download many apps, even when you put all of them on the SD card (remember: it still stores some inside).The battery feels ""OK"". Granted, if you do any graphics/CPU intensive --- which is basically any game on this phone --- it will drain fast. But first of all, I don't think this phone is for people who want to game and also demand good battery life. It's a basic Android phone for those that don't want to (or can't) buy subsidized. It also has Gingerbread, which ensures plenty of life time when it comes to apps. And even after that, there are Ice Cream Sandwich ROMs for it (still buggy, give them time...). The phone is good as it is, but it's nice to have the option. If you use all your regular apps and phone calls, the battery will last. Battery is not a problem under regular use.Performance wise, of course there are lags here and there. Ice Cream Sandwich provided a lot of bells and whistles (in this case, a much more fluid UI), and this phone has Gingerbread only (with no official updates beyond that). And... the hardware is very modest. The most impressive stuff is that Samsung made a very good job on this and other phones: it's more responsive than stock Android (I've read about them adding tile-rendering to the browser and other stuff added only later in Honeycomb, not sure about that).The camera is definitely subpar.
