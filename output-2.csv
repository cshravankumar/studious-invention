2,B000UWH40W,1298937600,"This is a beautiful GSM/3G phone with a bright, colorful screen and many features found in more expensive devices.  The Nokia 6555 will find the tower signal even if you live on Mars, and it will do it with great call clarity.  I have never had a more ergonomically pleasing keypad than the one on this phone---all buttons are smooth, require just the right amount of pressure, and they deliver the appropriate tactile feedback. BUT, battery life and function ruin an otherwise perfect machine. As other reviewers have aptly written, this phone ravishes battery power very quickly, even when you are cruising through the menus and not even talking. Adding insult to injury, the battery indicator on the screen drops slowly with the passing minutes then falls to ""low battery"" unexpectedly, oftentimes giving you a warning of a bare 3 minutes before all goes dead. I love this phone, BUT I ALWAYS CARRY MY OLD 5-YEAR-OLD NOKIA 1208 as a trusty backup. The 1208 has no internet, no camera, no bluetooth, and no music, but the battery lasts seemingly forever, and it will pick up a GSM signal maybe halfway to Mars. The Nokia 6555 is perfect except for its battery performance, but when I carry BOTH phones I get everything I need.

3,B000UWH40W,1193788800,"I've been a hard-core Nokia-only user for years (my last 4 or 5 phones.) My old candy-bar style Nokia with a tiny screen was getting old, so when I heard about this hot new flip phone from Nokia that was the same size, I wanted it.  Well, I got it and it isn't that great.  The 320x240 QVGA screen is nice and clear, but the software and services for it are not up to par with the latest from Sony, etc. that my friends at work show me.The USB connector is ""micro-USB"" so I had to order a new cable since all my cables are ""mini-USB"" which is only about 1mm larger.  Also, it has the narrow charging port, so all my old Nokia chargers are worthless.  The headphone jack is also micro-sized.  Who has micro-headphones?I'm pretty technically inclined, but I can't figure out how to wirelessly transfer my pictures off this camera.  So the 2 ways to get pics off are to buy the micro-USB cable, or yank out the micro-SD-RAM chip.

This phone is compact, and performed well when I saw it at the Cingular store.BUT today, I experienced the worst battery life that a cell phone could have. After charging this phone to the max, I texted my friends, and talked for about 3 hours when the battery indicator showed that 1/4 of its capacity. Then, my phone died. Usually, I'd have at least 1 hour left to use the phone, with an indication of 1/4 battery. BUT NO! It just died, and luckily, I wasn't in a situation where I needed a phone (I was at home all day today). Everyday since I got this phone, I've had to charge it.

Let me preface my review by saying I upgraded from a classic design $50 Tmobile Nokia that I bought two years ago and which had no fancy features but served me well. So I decided to go for a Nokia phone again and decided to buy the Nokia 6555 :)My verdict is I think its awesome and I'm very happy with it. It takes great pictures, has a nice interface and is sleek and easy to manipulate (keys are great).Like previous reviewers, I was surprised that the battery doesn't necessarily last a day even with just phone usage since my previous basic phone had a battery life that lasted up to a week. However, after chatting to my friends (who thanked me for coming into the 21st century with my new phone), I discovered that most 3G phones have a short battery life.So in all, I am really happy with my upgraded phone and recommend it to any Nokia fans :)",4,"11 6, 2007",Awesome phone despite battery life,Cell Phones,"Nokia 6555 Unlocked GSM Flip Phone with 1.3MP Camera, Video MP3/Video Player, Bluetooth and microSD Slot - Black",94.38,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 85983},Nokia,Cell_Phones,0.75306,0,0.75306

This phone is a beautiful phone (I had the black and red version) and will slip into even a small pocket.  After purchasing the phone, I looked up the reviews.

(Turning it on at 7:00 a.m.; off at 6:00 p.m.; with about 50 minutes of talk time/day)  I decided to take the phone back since 2 years is a long time to have a phone that begins with disappointing features.  The AT&T service rep. took back the phone with no questions asked. Before I told the rep I was continuing with the service, she even asked if I wanted to cancel the 2-year contract.

13,B000UWH40W,1208131200,"First, the bad. I purchased the Nokia 6555b from AT&T; Jan 8, 2008. Three weeks later the exterior mini-display was cracked and inoperable. I had worn it on my belt while driving and my seat belt buckle put enough pressure on the mini-display to crack it. VERY disappointing. All Nokia had to do was put a thicker, more rigid plastic cover over the display and it would be fine. Instead, I have a busted phone. Except for the broken mini-display and the inability to see the clock or caller ID, the phone still works, but that mini-display is a Bad Design.A lot of people complain about the battery. At first I experienced very short battery times as well. I even bought a second battery for $15 with some other accessories. I have never needed it. I believe the battery gets better with time. At first it was displaying low battery charge. Now it goes for a couple of days no problem. I charge it each night, though, just to be safe.I bought the 6555 because it works with the Acura Hands Free Link system via Bluetooth. (Not all Bluetooth phones do.) It also works with the Ford Sync system. Both work very well. It is indeed nice to place or receive calls without having to find the phone. No clumsy earphones. No looking away to dial or press buttons. No wires at all. My wife leaves hers in her purse, I leave my in my pocket (not wearing it on my belt anymore--I might break it again.) With Sync, the Bluetooth even allows the phone to become a media player. Very cool.Using the free downloadable Nokia software, you can edit the phonebook from your laptop via the special--and hard to find--micro USB cable that costs $15. But if your laptop has Bluetooth like mine--because I bought a Microsoft Bluetooth wireless laser mouse 8000 and its Bluetooth receiver also receives other Bluetooth devices like my phone--you can connect without having to buy the micro USB cable. The cable is handy to carry though, so you can connect the phone to other computers if necessary to download pictures and video if needed. Using this software, you can also make your own ring tones. My custom ringtone is Hillary Clinton cackling/laughing.The main display has a nice large font that is visible in broad daylight. Color combinations (themes) are adjustable and some are better than others, but it's nice to have options.The phone has a speaker phone built in if desired.It's easy to switch from ring to vibrate--just hold the # key for a few seconds.If you have MS Outlook as your emailer, you can sync your calendar.The 6555 comes with a host of useful tools including: a Stopwatch with split times; a Countdown Timer to remember to take the roast out on time; a full-function Calculator; an Alarm Clock; Notes; To-Do list; and a Calendar.It has some dumb games that are mostly demo only.It has a very mediocre still camera and an even more mediocre video camera.It can text, but I don't do that.It can be configured for Push-To-Talk, at extra cost, if you must have walkie talkie capability.I was worried about the tiny charging plug, but so far it's been durable, even though it did obsolete all my previous Nokia accessories.It does need a micro-mini plug for the headphones if you want to use it as a personal music player. Mine included a short Micro-to-Standard mini adapter so you can use your regular headphones.The Settings menu allows you to reconfigure what many of the buttons will do: if you need to get to some buried menu item like the calculator often, make the Right Selector button do it. One touch and you're in business. This is a very handy feature.Overall, I am quite pleased with the phone. The audio quality is fine, it rarely drops calls and is small, thin and lightweight. The only real problem is how fragile the outer display is. Nokia should have shipped it with a protector or engineered it better from the get-go.",3,"04 14, 2008",Good but fragile,Cell Phones,"Nokia 6555 Unlocked GSM Flip Phone with 1.3MP Camera, Video MP3/Video Player, Bluetooth and microSD Slot - Black",94.38,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 85983},Nokia,Cell_Phones,0.0346976,0.011565867,0.023131733
14,B000UWH40W,1197504000,"I replaced my Motorola L6 with this Nokia 6555. I liked the L6 except the keys were very small and close together, so I would sometimes hit the wrong key. Also, I had to lock the keys whenever I carried it so a key would not get pressed accidentally. What I needed was a flip phone with slightly larger keys and this Nokia was just the ticket.This cell phone has so many features that I will only list a few. First off, my friend just got a Samsung Blackjack II and this Nokia does almost all the same things that his does. They both have MP3, 3G, Bluetooth, internet access, camera, Micro SD memory ready, organizer, and more with services through ATT. As far as we can tell thus far is the only thing the Smartphones have the Nokia 6555 does not have is Microsoft Mobile Suite. The Blackjack keys are so tiny that I do not know how anyone can use them. Plus, the Blackjack cost much more. The better choice is by far the Nokia 6555.The only problem I am having is navigating the menus to find the settings I am looking for. I have to keep referring to the manual. I suppose after a while I will learn where everything is and memorize most of it.The battery life seems to be about average for a fully loaded cell phone. Maybe some day they will make batteries that last much longer for those power users that complain about short battery talk time. For now we just have to charge the battery more often. Not a big deal for me. If I plan to use the phone a lot, then I simply charge my phone and headset at night to have a full charge on both and I am ready to go the next day. If I do not use it very much, then I only have to charge them about every 3 or 4 days.Pros:Slim and stylish.Good sound quality.Many features.Cons:Menus difficult to navigate.UPDATE:Another con is the backlight only stays on for 10 seconds and there is no way to adjust it to stay on longer.",5,"12 13, 2007",This phone does just about everything,Cell Phones,"Nokia 6555 Unlocked GSM Flip Phone with 1.3MP Camera, Video MP3/Video Player, Bluetooth and microSD Slot - Black",94.38,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 85983},Nokia,Cell_Phones,-0.27939,-0.139695,-0.139695

I need to charge the battery pretty much every night.  I can go about a day and a half or 2 days if I stretch it.  If you talk a lot or intend to use the other features plan on charging it every night.  In their defense the battery life is rated at 3 hours of talk time and that is pretty much it.  You won't get more than that and like I said you won't get even that much if you do games or other stuff.  The other thing that was kind of disappointing was no ringtones installed except the standard ATT ring. (Correction).  There are a couple of ringtones installed I just wasn't looking in the right folder which is the biggest problem I have with it now.  The music hides in different menu folders and depending which menu you are in you won't see them which is why I didn't think there were any tones at first.

I did my homework before going to the store and I had narrowed my decision to 2 phones (an LG and a different model Nokia).  However, when I got to the store, I let the salesman talk me into this phone, which he said was a better quality, though at a higher price.  I took it home and immediately had problems. The vibration function did not work, no matter how much I adjusted settings, and the manual was no help.  I went online and saw that almost every review for this phone was negative.  Just this afternoon, the vibration miraculously started working, though intermittently, which confirmed to me that I had a defective phone.  I also was having problems with it powering down by itself, or suddenly lighting up--which was very annoying because I use my phone as an alarm clock so all of a sudden I would be awaken by a bright light in my room.  Perhaps mine was a lemon, however based on the other reviews I read, lemons with this model seem to happen fairly often.I also found that the way the operating system on the phone was set up was not very intuitive.  Maybe I just didn't spend enough time getting used to it (though I did spend about 4 hours on it last night trying to figure it out).  I consider myself fairly tech savvy, but I just don't understand why they make simple tasks like setting an alarm for am or pm require an additional 3 button pushes.  I also didn't need any of the ""sophisticated"" features, I only needed a phone that worked well as a phone, and that could text with relative simplicity.  The sound quality and signal strength were fairly good, but that was dwarfed by the other problems I was having. Based on my experience thus far, and the reviews I saw online, I took it back today and got the phone I originally was going to get.

54,B000WLZTTO,1240531200,[Note: my review is not about the seller but the device]I will not repeat every comment others made but I will say this: it works on the right frequency for high speed data if you DON'T live in the US. If you live in the US this phone is not for you. In addition (and possibly not coincidentally) this phone will eventually get into a mode where it will drain all the battery as it keeps talking to the network trying and failing to receive SMS. So you get no SMS and you soon (within hours) have a dead phone. I sent it in twice to Nokia (at my own expense) to get it fixed while it was under warranty but both times the problem re-appeared within days. Needless to say Nokia doesn't care - in fact their comment over the phone was that this device seems incompatible with my carrier! So much for US version. I wish someone had pointed all of this out when I bought the phone.,1,"04 24, 2009",Don't even think about buying this phone!,Cell Phones,"Nokia N73 Unlocked Smartphone with 3.2 MP Camera, 3G, MP3/Video Player, MiniSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)",349.99,{'Cell Phones & Accessories': 530957},Nokia,Cell_Phones,-0.413227,0,0
55,B000WLZTTO,1187827200,"Actually, I bought this phone by mistake, since I thought it wouldn't be shipped all the way to Colombia, but it did (in less than seven days). To this point I had only bought books through Amazon and in trying to buy other products had failed due to shipping restrictions, although Amazon and its reseller E-tronics came through this time. Great job guys.Ok, down the brass tax: the Nokia N73 ME is a complete multimedia experience, camera, music player, and yes a phone, complete with all the extras, which led me to sell my old iPod just last week. And since I didn't own a camera, it was fantastic. The camera works great (for a phone), although, you have to become a wiz at adjusting all the settings it comes packed with for your picture to come out great in environments with little light. I'm totally psyched with it, shooting everything that moves. The Symbian OS is well designed and pretty robust, supporting any kind of application you might find.The only downside is that at the beginning it was a little slow while browsing in between applications. But you can fix this problem by downloading the Nokia Software Updater which allows you to update your phone's firmware. I updated my N73 with the latest version (v.4.0727.2.2.1) and the problem was solved, along with dozens of other bugs. And in sync with the Nokia PC Suite it's like having your office in your pocket. Really it is.OK buddy, that's it for now. Hats off to Nokia for making an awesome phone. Your bank account might get pissed off, but your life will most definitely improve: your life in there. Oh, and the best of all is that my childish and unfounded need for the coveted iPhone is now gone.

This is a business phone for me,  I do a lot of texting and email, so limited charging, and shutting off won't work work for me.

96,B001F7VN6M,1282521600,"I waited until this phone was offered by Amazon directly because a year ago I purchased a BB Pearl from another vendor through Amazon and it did not last a year, failing from day one.  This time, I thought Amazon would be a more trustworthy source it was quite disappointing.  I got a phone in it's own box but firs thing that stroke me, a 1 year warranty card from Consumer Certified Repairs... this phone is supposed to be new!!!  I got a refurbished phone!!  Next disappointment, a cheap battery, not the original Blackberry battery.  It holds a charge for about 8 hours.  I had to but another one, which was another nightmare because Amazon sells many as ""the same that comes with Blackberry phones"" and the picture is of an original battery at $15.  Now I don't trust Amazon so I did not purchase any of these but had to shell out another $50 for a Seidio.  Another thing, I believe this phone should've included a protective ""leather"" case which comes with every BB and I did not get it.  Now my last and greatest grievance and it goes in another paragraph...I was not able to get this phone on a Blackberry plan!!  At the phone company they told me that the series this phone belongs to is not in the Blackberry database so it cannot be set up in the BB plan!  I did not get any specifics, not sure what that means and not even sure if it is banned for any reason or what.  Anyways, this is the last time I buy a cell phone from Amazon.

So anyway, the phone arrived in excellent condition (although it seems like this was a factory refurbished phone, but it still looked like new). I saw a little scratch on the screen when I unwrapped it, but it turns out the scratch was only on the plastic cover and didn't affect the phone.

The leading trendy iCompetitor to the Blackberry may have some limitations, but running the most basic of audio editing/composition apps isn't one of them: the Blackberry on the other hand has its audio hardware set up to only be able to play one [generated] sound at a time - i.e. it lacks true polyphony. This shouldn't be a showstopper - buffered synthesis being one possible solution - and yet there's not even the most basic MIDI composition available for the Bold.To which the BB die-hards reply, ""Ah, but the Blackberry's not a toy! It's a businessman's machine! Blackberry users are serious businesslike people.""...and yet there are apps available for astrology, palm reading, bible quotes, random noise players, etc. etc. - obviously all very relevant and important to business people. [eyes rolling]In the end, it's been a fine smartphone for me in just about every other regard more or less. A couple hassles, most easy to figure out with a little Google sleuthing.
