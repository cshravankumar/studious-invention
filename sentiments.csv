The actual function of this CLIKR-5 is OK, but the ergonomic design sets back remotes by 20 years.  The buttons are all the same, there's no separation of the number buttons, the volume and channel buttons are the same shape as the other buttons on the remote, and it all adds up to a crappy user experience.  Why would TWC accept this as a replacement?  This remote is virtually impossible to pick up and use without staring at it to make sure where your fingers are.  Heck, you have to feel around just to figure out if you've grabbed it by the top or bottom, since there's no articulation in the body of the thing to tell you which end is up.  Horrible, just horrible design.  I'm skipping this and paying double for a refurbished Synergy V.",2,Ergonomic nightmare,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",-0.466401Beauty,Perfume,Davidoff,A2TY0BTJOTENPG,511189877,Johnny Exx,0,1,"We had an old Time Warner Cable remote that was dropped into a bucket of dirty mop water.  We dried it out and it seemed to work ""fine"" except for the few times one of the batteries began to sizzle and smoke and became hotter than anything I had ever felt before and literally burned a hole in our couch upholstery.  Needless to say, this remote, the CLIKR-5, is awesome, easily programmed, and works perfectly with our TWC equipment and all the other A/V components.  I love this remote... great product.  (Probably goes without saying, but just in case, you don't get the TWC logo on it.)",5,Excellent replacement to Time Warner Cable remote,1395878400,"03 27, 2014",0.129817Beauty,Perfume,Random,A34ATBPOK6HCHY,511189877,Nancy C.
